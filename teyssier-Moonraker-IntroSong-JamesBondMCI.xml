<Verse>
Where are you
Why do you hide
Where is that moonlight trail that leads to your side
Just like the moonraker goes
In search of his dream of gold
I search for love
For someone to have and hold
</Verse>
<PreChorus>
I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
</PreChorus>
<Chorus>
And it always seems
You love me
You love me
</Chorus>

<Verse>
Where are you
When will we meet
Take my unfinished life and make it complete
Just like the moonraker knows
His dream will come true someday
I know that you
Are only a kiss away
</Verse>
<PreChorus>
I've seen your smile
In a thousand dreams
Felt your touch
</PreChorus>
<Chorus>
And it always seems
You love me
You love me
</Chorus>
</IntroSong>
