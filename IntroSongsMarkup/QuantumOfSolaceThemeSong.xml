<IntroSong><Verse num="1">Another ringer with the slick trigger finger,
For Her Majesty,
Another one with the golden tongue,
Poisoning your fantasy,
Another bill from a killer,
Turned a thriller to a tragedy.</Verse>

<Verse num="1">A door left open,
A woman walking by,
A drop in the water,
A look in the eye,
A phone on the table,
A man on your side,
Oh, someone that you think that you can trust,
Is just,
Another way to die.</Verse>

Another tricky little gun,
Giving solace to the one,
That will never see the sunshine,
Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother,
In the nick of time,
Another dirty money "heaven sent honey",
Turning on a dime.

Well, a door left open,
A woman walking by,
A drop in the water,
A look in the eye,
A phone on the table,
A man on your side,
Someone that you think that you can trust,
Is just,
Another way to die.

(It's just another)
Hey! Another way to die!
(Another way to die...)
Shoot 'em, bang bang!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Another girl with her finger,
On the world singing to,
you what you wanna hear?
Another gun thrown down and surrendered,
Took away your fear,
Hey!
Another man that stands right behind you,
Looking in the mirror

Oh, a door left open,
A woman walking by,
A drop in the water,
A look in the eye,
A phone on the table,
A man on your side,
Someone that you think that you can trust,
Is just,
Another way to die

It's another way!
Shoot 'em up, bang bang!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
(Another way, another way...)
Yeah!
(Another way, another way...)
Bang bang bang bang!</IntroSong>
