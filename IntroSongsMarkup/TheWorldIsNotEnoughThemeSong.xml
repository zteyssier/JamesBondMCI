<IntroSong><Verse type="1"><FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> know how to hurt,
<FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> know how to heal,
<FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> know what to show,
and what to conceal,
<FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> know when to talk,
and <FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> know when to touch,
no one ever died from wanting too much.</Verse>

<Chorus type="1"><FilmTitle>The world is not enough</FilmTitle>,
but it is such a perfect place to start my love,
and if you're strong enough,
together we can take the world apart my love.</Chorus>

<Verse type="2">People like us,
know how to survive,
there's no point in living,
If you can't feel alive,
we know when to kiss,
and we know when to kill,
If we can't have it all, then nobody will.</Verse>

<Chorus type="2"><FilmTitle>The world is not enough</FilmTitle>,
but it is such a perfect place to start my love,
and if you're strong enough,
together we can take the world apart my love.</Chorus>

<Verse type="3"><FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> feel safe,
and <FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> feel scared.
<FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> feel ready,
and yet unprepared.</Verse>

<Outro>The world is not enough,
the world is not enough,
we're nowhere near enough,
the world is not enough.</Outro></IntroSong>
