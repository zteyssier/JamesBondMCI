<sd>GUN BARREL LOGO
An animated white dot moves in from frame-left and centres on

A MAN enters the dot walking from right to left, the iris
moving to centre-frame with him. He jumps to face f.g.,
pointing a gun and shooting. Red colour falls in f.g. from
the top of the frame. The iris wanders then starts to fall to

They got a lot closer to you in
Jamaica, didn't they? -- Well,

Auric Goldfinger. Sounds like a
French nail varnish.</sp>

He's British, but he doesn't sound
like it. Big operator, world-wide
interests, all apparently quite
reputable. Owns one of the finest
stud farms in the States.</sp>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
(zipping up his top)
What's the tie-up with Washington?</sp>

Goldfinger picks up a pencil and starts to write on a notepad.
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Same stakes?</sp>
<sp><spk>SIMMONS</spk>
Let's double it. Five dollars a

Goldfinger looks up in surprise then takes a hearing-aid
amplifier from his pocket and turns up the volume.
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Did you say five?</sp>
<sp><spk>SIMMONS</spk>
My luck's got to change sometime.</sp>

Nod your head if you agree.</sp>
Goldfinger sits in silent fury.

Good. Now start losing,

No, let's be generous. Let's make
it fifteen thousand.</sp>

A servant, BRUNSKILL, walks over holding a cigar box. He

<pg>28.</pg>
<spk>SMITHERS</spk>
We here at the Bank of England,
Mister Bond, are the official
depository for gold bullion, just as
Fort Knox, Kentucky is for the
United States. We know, of course,
the amounts we each hold, we know
the amounts deposited in other
banks, and we can estimate what is
being held for industrial purposes.
This enables the two governments to
establish respectively the true
value of the dollar and the pound.
Consequently, we are vitally
concerned with unauthorized
leakages.
<spk>BOND</spk>
I take it you mean...
TWO-SHOT - BOND AND SMITHERS
<spk>BOND</spk>
...smuggling.
<spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Yes.
Brunskill holds the box out to Smithers and he takes a cigar,
then hands it back so Brunskill can clip its end. Meanwhile
"M" off-screen lights his cigar and blows out a puff of smoke.
<spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Gold, gentlemen, which has been
melted down and recast, is
virtually untraceable, which makes
it, uh, unlike diamonds, ideal for
smuggling, attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals.
Brunskill, bowing slightly, hands Smithers the clipped cigar.
<spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Thank you, Brunskill. That will be
all.

Thank you, sir.
Brunskill exits. Smithers picks up the decanter and hands it

<spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Gentlemen, Mister Goldfinger has
gold bullion on deposit in Zurich,
Amsterdam, Caracas and Hong Kong,
worth twenty million pounds. Most
of it comes from this country.
Bond passes him the decanter.
<spk>BOND</spk>
Well, why move it?
Smithers passes the decanter to "M."
<pg>30.</pg>
<spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Because the price of gold varies
from country to country. If you
buy it here at thirty dollars an
ounce, you can sell it in, say,
Pakistan at a hundred and ten
dollars and triple your money...
"M" holding the stopper in his hand, sniffs at the decanter then
looks up at Bond.

through it.
IN THE WASHROOM
Bond opens a cabinet mirror and looks behind it.
He holds his hand in front of the mirror and sees it through
the back of the mirror.
Bond turns, picks up his suitcase and opens it so that the lid
blocks the view through the mirror.
IN THE CABIN
Mei Lei backs away, her view blocked again.
IN THE WASHROOM
Bond takes a razor from his shaving kit.
He unscrews the handle, drops a mini-Homer device into his

the heel of his shoe, inserts the device into a slot and
closes the heel.
Bond rises, shutting his suitcase and picking up a can of
shaving cream.

Mei Li looks through the peephole again.

That's a Smith and Wesson fortyfive. If you fire it at this close

Johnnie again sits in the driver's seat of the Thunderbird.
He hears the scope beeping and looks at it.
The beep indicator is moving.
He gets out of the car and honks the horn. Felix hurries out
of the restaurant eating.
<spk>JOHNNIE</spk>
He's on the move!
Felix takes another bite and heads for the car.
Johnnie backs the car up. Felix rushes into the passenger
seat and they take off.
THE CADILLAC
turns a corner at "Joe's Drive-In" and heads up another
street.
THE THUNDERBIRD
follows up the same street.
IN THE THUNDERBIRD
Felix looks at the scope. The beep indicator moves upwards.
<spk>FELIX</spk>
Slow down. Don't crowd him.
The Thunderbird keeps following.
THE CADILLAC
cruises along. Solo sits impassively in the back seat as
Oddjob drives.
<pg>109.</pg>
The Cadillac passes under bridge where a sign reads,
"INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." Then it passes a sign at the side of
the road that reads, "AIRPORT."
<spk>SOLO</spk>
(looking back)
Are you blind or something? You
missed the turn!
Oddjob looks purposefully ahead.
ON A SIDE ROAD
The Cadillac rounds a corner. It stops at the side of the
road. Solo, puzzled, looks back.
Oddjob picks up a pistol with a silencer and aims it at him.
Solo looks forward again and sees the gun. His eyes open wide
in shock.
Oddjob shoots him in the chest. Solo falls back against his

Oddjob peers down at him smugly.

He turns into a scrap yard where scrap metal is piled into
pyramids. A sign on the wall reads, "ATLANTIC IRON AND METAL

IN THE SCRAP YARD
Oddjob pulls to a stop, gets out of the Cadillac and walks
away.
Just then grab hooks descend onto the car. They surround the
roof, gripping the car, and raise it into the air.
The hooks swing the car overhead then drop it into a carcrushing machine. The flanges of the machine start to close
on the car.
SERIES OF SHOTS
The machine's hydraulics compress the car into a foot-square
cube.
The flanges retract and a gateway opens. A metal arm pushes
the cube out through the gateway.
An electromagnet snags the cube from above. It lifts the cube
into the air then lowers it into the back of Oddjob's blue
pickup truck as Oddjob (looking thinner) approaches the truck.
Oddjob gets in behind the wheel and glances back as the cargo
is lowered into place.
Oddjob drives away.

INTERCUT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
American motorists kill that many

<spk>BOND</spk>
Yes, well, I've worked out a few
statistics of my own.
(sits across the
 table from him)
Fifteen billion dollars in gold
bullion weighs ten thousand, five
hundred tons. Sixty men would take
twelve days to load it onto two
hundred trucks. Now, at the most,
you're going to have two hours
before the army, navy, air force,
marines move in and make you put it
back.
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Who mentioned anything about
removing it?
Bond stops drinking. Kisch leans back against a pillar behind

<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Is the julep tart enough for you?
<spk>BOND</spk>
(thinking)
You plan to break into the world's
largest bank, but not to steal
anything. Why?
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Go on, Mister Bond.
<spk>BOND</spk>
Mister Ling, the Red Chinese agent
at the factory. He's a specialist
in nuclear fission. -- But of
course!
Goldfinger smiles back at him.
<spk>BOND</spk>
His government's given you a bomb!
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
I prefer to call it an atomic
device. It's small, but
particularly dirty.
<spk>BOND</spk>
Cobalt and iodine?
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Precisely.
<spk>BOND</spk>
Well, if you explode it in Fort
Knox, the, uh, entire gold supply
of the United States will be
radioactive for... fifty-seven
years!
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Fifty-eight, to be exact.
<spk>BOND</spk>
I apologize, Goldfinger. It's an
inspired deal. They get what they
want -- economic chaos in the West
-- and the value of your gold
increases many times.
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
I conservatively estimate ten
times.
<pg>116.</pg>
<spk>BOND</spk>
Brilliant. But the atomic device,
as you call it, is already,
obviously in this country.
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Obviously.
<spk>BOND</spk>
But bringing it to Fort Knox, uh,
undetected could be risky -- very
risky.
<spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Oh the contrary, Mister Bond. The
risk is all on your side. If the
authorities should attempt to
locate it, who knows where it might
be exploded, eh? Perhaps the
Polaris submarine pens at New
London, Cape Kennedy, near the
White House... But we are
speculating idly. Operation Grand
Slam will be successful. You will
be there to see for yourself -- to
closely for comfort, I'm afraid.

Goldfinger approaches the pickup truck.

He bangs on the back of the truck and walks off with it.
Pussy crosses behind Bond and links an arm through his.
