<sd>GUN BARREL LOGO
An animated white dot moves in from frame-left and centres on

Auric Goldfinger. Sounds like a

He's British, but he doesn't sound

interests, all apparently quite
reputable. Owns one of the finest
stud farms in the States.</sp>

<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Same stakes?</sp>

Goldfinger looks up in surprise then takes a hearing-aid
amplifier from his pocket and turns up the volume.

sip.
A servant, BRUNSKILL, walks over holding a cigar box. He
offers it to "M" who takes a cigar, then crosses behind Bond

<sp><spk>SMITHERS</spk>
We here at the Bank of England,
Mister Bond, are the official
depository for gold bullion, just as
Fort Knox, Kentucky is for the
United States. We know, of course,
the amounts we each hold, we know
the amounts deposited in other
banks, and we can estimate what is
being held for industrial purposes.
This enables the two governments to
establish respectively the true
value of the dollar and the pound.
Consequently, we are vitally
concerned with unauthorized
leakages.</sp>

I take it you mean...</sp>
TWO-SHOT - BOND AND SMITHERS
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
...smuggling.</sp>
<sp><spk>SMITHERS</spk>

Brunskill holds the box out to Smithers and he takes a cigar,
then hands it back so Brunskill can clip its end. Meanwhile
"M" off-screen lights his cigar and blows out a puff of smoke.
<sp><spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Gold, gentlemen, which has been
melted down and recast, is
virtually untraceable, which makes
it, uh, unlike diamonds, ideal for
smuggling, attracting the biggest

Brunskill, bowing slightly, hands Smithers the clipped cigar.
<sp><spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Thank you, Brunskill. That will be

<sp><spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Gentlemen, Mister Goldfinger has
gold bullion on deposit in Zurich,
Amsterdam, Caracas and Hong Kong,
worth twenty million pounds. Most
of it comes from this country.
Bond passes him the decanter.</sp>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
Well, why move it?</sp>
Smithers passes the decanter to "M."
<pg>30.</pg>
<sp><spk>SMITHERS</spk>
Because the price of gold varies
from country to country. If you
buy it here at thirty dollars an
ounce, you can sell it in, say,
Pakistan at a hundred and ten
dollars and triple your money...</sp>
"M" holding the stopper in his hand, sniffs at the decanter then

Just then two men in blue jumpsuits round the far corner of
the building, speaking together in Korean.
A CONCRETE BUILDING
DOLLY BACK and PAN on Bond as he passes the building. The
shadows of the other men cross it. He looks back then runs
ahead.
AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING
Bond rounds the corner and leans back against the building,
then glances back. The other men round the corner of the
building behind him. They are laughing.
Bond runs off, passing some metal drums and a sign on a wall
that says, in German, "EINTRITT STRENGSTENS VERBOTEN" ("entry
strictly forbidden"). He quickly finds himself in a dead-end,
blocked by another building. He looks back desperately.
ALONGSIDE THE BRICK BUILDING
The two guards continue forward.
BOND runs back past the sign, mounts a fire-escape ladder and
starts climbing up. He stops on a ledge, then climbs up to
the next level.
ON A LEDGE
Louvers on the building's windows provide ventilation. Bond
comes around the corner, stopping on the ledge near the
louvers. He looks down to see the two guards turn the other
way. Then he turns to the louvers and looks inside.
BOND'S POV - INSIDE THE BUILDING
Goldfinger's Rolls is partially dismantled. WORKERS -- all of
them wearing blue jumpsuits and yellow sashes -- pass to and
from it as red smoke rises from a furnace in b.g.

BOND tilts the louvers so he can have a better view. He looks
inside again.
BOND'S POV - INT. FACTORY - SAME TIME
The Roll's grill is in f.g. A worker removes one of the
golden headlamps, walks back and sets it down. Meanwhile two
others remove one of the golden doors, carry it back and set
it down.
At the same time, Goldfinger and LING -- a Chinese operative
in a Mao jacket -- approach from b.g.:
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Smuggling is an art, Mister Ling...</sp>
ANGLE ON OTHER WORKERS
They pour molten gold into an ingot mold.

Steam sounds from the melted gold, drowning out the rest of
his sentence.

CLOSE SHOT - BOND
keeps looking in through the louvers, excited at his find.
INSIDE
Goldfinger escorts Ling past a dolly bearing gold ingots.
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
We dismantle it here. We reduce
the gold in this special furnace,
which in turn...
(noise drowns him out)
... weighing approximately two
tons.</sp>
He raises his fist to his mouth, coughing, then leads Ling
off.
<pg>65.</pg>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
I make six trips a year to the
continent in the Rolls Royce,
Mister Ling...</sp>
OUTSIDE
Bond looks downward in satisfaction. He has solved his case.
He looks again through the louvers, then suddenly looks to the
side.
BOND'S POV - THE FACTORY ENTRANCE
Ling exits the factory then leans against a railing as
Goldfinger follows.
<sp><spk>LING</spk>
Perhaps it would be wiser to
suspend your other activities.</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Now, Mister Ling, please assure
your principals Operation Grand
Slam will have my undivided
attention.</sp>
Goldfinger leads him down a few steps and around a corner of
the building.
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Now, there are certain matters we

Pussy looks at a clipboard.
Bond sips his drink.

What's the matter, Solo? Too big

Goldfinger looks over at other gangsters. They look back at
him. He looks at another group of gangsters. They look back.
Under the model, Bond watches.
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Gentlemen, we must respect Mister
Solo's decision. Please excuse me
for a few minutes while I take care
of him. Make yourselves
comfortable.</sp>
Goldfinger leads Solo toward the door.
UNDER THE MODEL
Bond takes the Homer from his heel, folds the paper around it
and slips it into his pocket.
He looks through the model again. He hears general hubbub
from the gangsters, and a few clear words:
FIRST GANGSTER
How do we get it out?
<pg>104.</pg>
SECOND GANGSTER
That's the bit I want to hear.
THIRD GANGSTER
Yeah, and it had better be good.
TILT DOWN to Bond's feet. Suddenly a pair of hands grab his
ankles and yank on them. He falls face-down onto the
platform.
The hands pull him back and hurl him against a wall. He turns
around and suddenly stops.
His assailant is Pussy. She glares at him with her hands on
her hips.
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
Pussy! Well, who taught you judo?</sp>
She holds her hand out. DOLLY BACK as she steps forward; a
guard crosses behind her.
<sp><spk>PUSSY</spk>
The gun you took.</sp>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
Oh, the gun. The gun, of course.</sp>
He takes it from his pocket and hands it to her handle-first.
She motions to him to go back down the corridor. He starts
walking. She hands the gun to one of the guards.
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
We must have a few fast falls
together sometime.</sp>

Felix takes another bite and heads for the car.
Johnnie backs the car up. Felix rushes into the passenger

ON A SIDE ROAD
The Cadillac rounds a corner. It stops at the side of the

Oddjob picks up a pistol with a silencer and aims it at him.

INTERCUT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
American motorists kill that many

<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
Yes, well, I've worked out a few
statistics of my own.
(sits across the
 table from him)
Fifteen billion dollars in gold
bullion weighs ten thousand, five
hundred tons. Sixty men would take
twelve days to load it onto two
hundred trucks. Now, at the most,
you're going to have two hours
before the army, navy, air force,
marines move in and make you put it
back.</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>

Goldfinger smiles back at him.
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
His government's given you a bomb!</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
I prefer to call it an atomic

particularly dirty.</sp>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
Cobalt and iodine?</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Precisely.</sp>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
Well, if you explode it in Fort

of the United States will be
radioactive for... fifty-seven
years!</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Fifty-eight, to be exact.</sp>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
I apologize, Goldfinger. It's an
inspired deal. They get what they
want -- economic chaos in the West

increases many times.</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
I conservatively estimate ten
times.</sp>
<pg>116.</pg>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
Brilliant. But the atomic device,
as you call it, is already,
obviously in this country.</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Obviously.</sp>
<sp><spk>BOND</spk>
But bringing it to Fort Knox, uh,
undetected could be risky -- very
risky.</sp>
<sp><spk>GOLDFINGER</spk>
Oh the contrary, Mister Bond. The
risk is all on your side. If the
authorities should attempt to
locate it, who knows where it might
be exploded, eh? Perhaps the
Polaris submarine pens at New
London, Cape Kennedy, near the
White House... But we are
speculating idly. Operation Grand
Slam will be successful. You will
