      <Heading>EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN</Heading>

      <sd>Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN

      We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known
      World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.

      In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.

      Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
      over a cliff:

      AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.

      Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
      the ice. A human figure. This is:

      JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.

      Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
      an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
      backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
      JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -

      CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
      below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
      looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            There has to be an easier way to earn
                 a living.</sp>

      <sd>Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -

      ANOTHER ANGLE -

      He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a
      toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -

      THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -

      BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -

      And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of
      water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached
      to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.

      Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and
      forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.

      At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other
      pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:

      THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

      Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on
      the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.

      ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -

      Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally
      frayed through.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
      himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
      ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,
      he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely
      holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.</sd>
</Scene>

      <Scene num="2">
            <Heading>EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -</Heading>

      <sd>Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -
      through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.

      As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he
      smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -

      THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -

      Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.

      IN THE WATERBED -

      A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,
      he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.

      NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)

      Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:

      BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -

      On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled
      down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
      In other words: This was the only way in.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
      CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the
      side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.

      He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
      slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.</sd>

      <Scene num="4">
            <Heading>EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -</Heading>

      <sd>Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
      amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.</sd></Scene>

      <Scene num="5"><Heading>EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -</Heading>

      <sd>Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the
      bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:

      A ROCK OUTCROPPING.

      Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He
      unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a
      HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:

      A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)

      50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen
      MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the
      ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying
      HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.

      Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with
      INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.

      BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.

      THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -

      He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining
      over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

      THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON.</sd>

      <sd>Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS,
      including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK,
      an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6.

      M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:</sd>

                 Something about this 'not being a job

      <sd>THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond adjusts a knob on the scope.

      MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -

      On the video-screen, the picture zooms to a CLOSE UP of one of the
      arms traders. Tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the
      man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen.</sd>

      <sd>Bond shifts his aim, east. (Intercut as necessary) He zeroes in on

      <sd>THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond has taken his eye from the scope. He's peering at:

      THE MIG-29'S - ("MiG-1," AND "MiG-2") -

      A FORKLIFT appears from behind the TRUCK blocking the view of "MiG-l"
      A TALL BALD MAN is riding the empty fork, with his back to us.

      BOND -

      Puts his eye back on the scope, shifts the rifle -

      MI-6/VIDEO WALL -

      Bond's scope view settles on THE BALD MAN. The forklift reaches the
      back of the truck. HE STEPS OFF as the fork begins rising to unload
      something. And as the man turns, FACING US to scan the area:</sd>

      <sd>THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -

      Bond's headset lies on top of the rock, along with the telescopic
      sight - still broadcasting.

      Find Bond, crouching BEHIND the rock. Automatic rifle in one hand,
      GRENADE in the other. He pulls the pin, hurls it 40 feet away.
      Pauses. Waits, counting down time. Then -

      BOND SPRINGS. SHOOTS at one of the CRATES. IT BLOWS UP, just as -
      THE GRENADE EXPLODES.

      There's PANIC ON THE GROUND. Men running everywhere as THE RADAR/
      GATLING GUN spins, and SENDS A HAIL OF FIRE at Bond's diversion.

      And with this, BOND is off, SPRINTING INTO THE CHAOS.

      THE SAME SCENE - VIDEO SCREEN - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM.

      Stoned silence. Disbelief. Tanner whispers:</sd>

      THE SECRET AIR BASE -

      As various factions shoot at each other (Who's the traitor?) Bond
      streaks toward the action. Without breaking stride, he swings his
      gun to the right: TWO BURSTS. THREE MEN DIE. Still running, he
      swings to the left: ANOTHER BURST. TWO MORE DOWN.

      Ahead, Bond sees the FLIGHT CREWS DASHING for the MiG's. He makes a
      beeline for MiG-1.

      ANGLE ON THE BALD MAN -

      Slamming the gate on the RED BOX in a cargo truck. Rushing to the
      passenger door. Climbing in. The SHORT ROUND MAN floors the
      accelerator, driving them away.

      <sd>WIDE ON MiG-1 -

      The pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit. Running at full tilt,
      BOND LEAPS, pulls the man down. They fall to the tarmac, FIGHTING.
      Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him.

      Kneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is
      coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE
      from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart.

      ANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT.

      RETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT -

      Where the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's
      not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH
      THE HELMET. The copilot collapses into his seat, unconscious.

      Bond settles into his seat, fires the engines, closes the double
      canopy, and begins taxiing out.

                 007, I'd like to see you in my office.
                 Why don't you and the Colonel exchange
                 numbers if you need more information?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Yes, M.</sp>

      <sd>M exits. Bond approaches Dominique. She smiles, warmly. There's a
      mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Interesting presentation.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">DOMINIQUE</spk>              Interesting video tape.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            They point, I shoot.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">DOMINIQUE</spk>                    (feels her pockets)
                 Do you have a pen? I just got promoted
                 and don't have my new cards yet.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Of course.</sp>

      <sd>Bond hands her a PEN. She regards it cautiously.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">DOMINIQUE</spk>              ... Does this do anything?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Depends what number you write.</sp>

      <sd>She gives him a wry look; starts to write. He notes her WEDDING BAND.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Married?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">DOMINIQUE</spk>              Happily.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... Kids?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">DOMINIQUE</spk>              Three. You? Married?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            No.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">DOMINIQUE</spk>                    (smiles)
                 I didn't think so.</sp>

      <sd>For an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness? Re-
      morse? Either way, she's scored a subtle victory.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">DOMINIQUE</spk>              Here. I gave you my assistant's
                 phone number. If it's urgent, she
                 knows where to reach me.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Thanks.
                       (beat, holding her gaze)

                 On the hidden camera.</sp>

      <sd>Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique
      leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them.</sd>

                         <sp><spk sex="F">MONEYPENNY</spk>                By the way, James: Ordinarily I would

                 for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have
                 you ever known me to kiss and tell?</sp>

      <sd>They've come to a security door. She punches in a code -</sd>

                         <sp><spk sex="F">MONEYPENNY</spk>                Actually, I've never known you to do

                         <sp><spk sex="F">MONEYPENNY</spk>                No, 007. It's just that I've learned
                 from personal experience - that when

                       (beat)
                 Somehow the reality is never as...
                 Satisfying as the fantasy.</sp>

      <sd>Bond scowls. Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door:</sd>

      <Scene num="25"><Heading>INT. M'S OFFICE - DAY</Heading>

      <sd>M is behind her desk; MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a high-
      handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            Come in, 007. You know the Minister?</sp>

      <sd>Bond sits in an armchair. M presses a button, and a video/bio of
      ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her. Mid-50's, regal.</sd>

      <sd>Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically. Then a very tight-lipped M. He
      senses he's about to enter a minefield:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... What's Harmsway done?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            It seems, 007, we've received a tip</sp>

                              <sp><spk sex="M">MINISTER JOHNSTONE</spk>
                 A rumor - from an anonymous source -</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            - that Sir Elliot may be involved
                 with Stamper and Yung, and the
                 missing Uranium.</sp>

                              <sp><spk sex="M">MINISTER JOHNSTONE</spk>
                 Hearsay. Idle chatter from a source
                 you can't identify - who insists on
                 talking only to 007. Nothing but
                 loose talk and innuendo.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            That may be the case at present,
                 Minister Johnstone... But our own
                 sources suspect that Mr. Harmsway
                 used his considerable Russian media
                 - holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky
                 President of the Ukraine - in trade
                 for the uranium.</sp>

                 More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.</sp>

                          <sp> <spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Perhaps. But it does explain how an

                 long-time friend of the people.

                       (annoyed)
                 Need I remind the two of you that
                 Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway
                 - is directly descended from the Earl
                 of Aberdeen? That his Scottish
                 ancestors practically invented Hong
                 Kong - and out of sheer gratitude,
                 Queen Victoria herself named the port
                 "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>                  (long pause, then:)
                 ... No more than I need remind you,
                 Minister, that merely being a member
                 of the lucky sperm club - does not
                 preclude one from a life of criminal
                 activity.</sp>

      <sd>Johnstone is reeling. M continues, to Bond, with aplomb:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            The reason I invited the Minister
                 here, 007, was to reassure him that
                 this investigation will be handled
                 with the utmost discretion.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Of course.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            Which is also why I've withheld this
                 information from NATO and our allies.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (nods, then, recalling)
                 ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            Yes. 1988. He was furious at the
                 British plan to return Hong Kong, and
                 supposedly started his own negotiations
                 with the Chinese Government. The inquiry
                 went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a
                 rather powerful enemy -</sp>

                              <sp><spk sex="M">MINISTER JOHNSTONE</spk>
                 Not to mention the chaos it caused at
                 Whitehall when his newspapers began
                 screaming for the recall of the
                 sitting government.</sp>

                 involved with the enriched uranium,
                 and, if so, stop him.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            How will I meet the informant?</sp>

                       (standing, to leave)
                 There is one last thing, 007: Elliot
                 Harmsway is vital to the economic
                 interests of this nation. He's also
                 a major contributor to the party. I
                 expect him to be given every consideration.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Political considerations?</sp>

                              <sp><spk sex="M">MINISTER JOHNSTONE</spk>
                 To the best of my recollection, Mr.

                       (beat, at the door)
                 In fact, I was never here.</sp>

      <sd>Bond is silent, chastised. M looks away, then looks back:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            But if Elliot Harmsway is involved

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Hopefully, it won't get that far.</sp>

      <sd>Saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with M. He takes off the cast

     <sd> Saunders has opened the briefcase. Bond tries to look inside, but
      Saunders repositions it. Saunders continues:</sd>

                                                                    CUT TO:

      <sd>EXT. VENICE HARBOR/GRAND CANAL - NIGHT

      A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge
      tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.)

      Tonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water...

      Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed
      partygoers and musicians in medieval garb.

      Wearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond
      alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd.

      EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT

      A swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic
      celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face:

      NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue.

      Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right,
      anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it?

      THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>WOMAN</spk>
                 Buona sera, signore -</sp>

      <sd>He's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>MAN</spk>
                 Vino?</sp>

      <sd>Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a
      group of celebrants carrying a long banner.

      Suddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the
      EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square.

      Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look
      forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind.
      He can only crane his neck to see/hear -</sd>

                              <sp><spk>MASKED WOMAN</spk>
                 I may have been followed. Meet me at
                 the Church in five minutes!</sp>

      <sd>With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save
      the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks
      behind him.

      SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT

      Five minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The
      MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and
      the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly -

      Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Looking for someone?</sp>

      <sd>Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS
      removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>
                 Hello, James.</sp>

      <sd>Bond reacts. He is not happy to see her.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Paris?!? What are you doing here?</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Is that any way to say hello?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I thought your specialty was good-bye.</sp>

      <sd>Paris smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair -</sd>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Oh, James. I've missed you -</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (grabbing her by the wrist)
                 Is this another one of your games?</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't
                 you just be nice?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I've got half the British government
                 breathing down my neck. I don't have
                 time for your nonsense.</sp>

      <sd>She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness.</sd>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Don't you even miss me? Didn't I
                 mean anything to you?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Nothing.</sp>

      <sd>She turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is
                 this just another one of your stunts?</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>                   (anguished)
                 No! He's crazy - he's insane. He
                 hates everybody. He's got these
                 plans -
                       (facing Bond, becoming hysterical:)
                 You've got to help me, James. I'm
                 sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I
                 know I was wrong - but you've got to
                 protect me. I know you still love -</sp>

      <sd>BOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered:</sd>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Do you feel better now?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (not giving an inch)
                 Do you?</sp>

      <sd>She turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            What about the uranium?</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             It's on the boat. He's holding a
                 press conference tomorrow.</sp>

      <sd>Bond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her
      face in his shoulder.</sd>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll
                 never leave you again.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (patting her head)
                 Shhhhh...</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Just hold me.</sp>

      <sd>Bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot
      backwards, to look in her eyes:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            How do you know Harmsway?</sp>

      <sd>Paris' eyes flicker at something over Bond's shoulder. She swoons:</sd>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Kiss me.</sp>

      <sd>She pulls Bond to her, kissing him - then HAULS OFF, BELTING him
      across the mouth.</sd>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Bastard! Leave me alone!</sp>

      <sd>She shoves him off, darts away. Bond is bleeding from his mouth -
      and not altogether surprised at her behavior. He turns to see -

      ANOTHER ANGLE - SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - (BOND'S POV) -

      Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats,
      enveloped from head-to-foot in BLACK CAPES. Their faces are
      completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but
      their chins. They look like messengers of death.

      CLOSER ON PARIS AND THE MEN -

      The leader is STAMPER; the others are locals, THUG #1, #2, #3. (THUG
      #1 is built like a bank vault.) Stamper looks steadily at Bond</sd>

                              <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>
                 Who is he?</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Nobody. Just some drunk. Leave him
                 alone -</sp>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>                    (to Thug #3)
                 Take her to the boat.</sp>

      <sd>RETURN ON BOND -

      He sees STAMPER and the TWO HENCHMEN approaching. He turns and walks
      quickly toward -

      EXT. RIALTO BRIDGE - FIRST (UP) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

      Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of
      the bridge. At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -

      THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.

      BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing
      up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -
      completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.

      BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,
      dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.

      STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -

      And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES
      PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper and Co.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (to himself, flexing the cape)
                 So that's how he does it.</sp>

      <sd>Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.

      Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but
      Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.

      RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT

      As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:

      THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing
      carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -

      But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes
      right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,
      pulling the men down, after him.

      BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT

      Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:

      A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -

      and just beyond this -

      A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.

      BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the
      picture for him.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Prego, prego. Permissio.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>TOURIST</spk>
                 Grazie.</sp>

      <sd>Bond takes the camera. The tourists pose. And with perfect timing,
      Bond turns, and - POP! - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG #l's face
      just as he comes around the corner.

      Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Grazie -</sp>

      <sd>And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the
      thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.

      The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart
      stops on top of him, pinning him down.

      BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.

      Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS
      in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed
      off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -

      007 disappears down the sidestreet.

      Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO
      MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of
      the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT
      INTO THE CANAL.

      RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -

      Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug
      #1 disappear onto the side Street.

      Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course
      along the canals toward -

      THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT

      Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close
      to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.

      ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -

      Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.

      BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA

      Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and
      start looking for him.

      RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -

      Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:

      THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast
      move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing
      it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from
      under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.
      (He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)

      NEW ANGLE -

      Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the
      courtyard of Il Bovolo.

      RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -

      Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he
      pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the
      cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -

      The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,
      hurling him against the opposite wall.

      With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>THUG #2</spk>
                 Marco - I didn't know -</sp>

                              <sp><spk>THUG #1</spk>
                 After him!</sp>

      <sd>They charge off.

      IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT

      Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No
      way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH
      FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.

      THE SPIRAL STAIRS -

      Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.

      RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -

      The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR
      BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.

      THE BALCONY -

      Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the
      building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the
      courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.

      Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.

      Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the
      GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and
      disappears from sight...

      Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.

      FIRST ROOFTOP -

      Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are
      SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop
      to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.

      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

      007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold
      on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:
      The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.

      As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -

      RETURN ON THE BALCONY -

      Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy
      to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.

      FIRST ROOFTOP -

      Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the
      next building. He makes a running leap.

      SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -

      Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They
      grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the
      roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.

      AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the
      skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.

      007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1
      tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO
      BOND'S LEGS.

      They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the
      two of them fall -

      CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -

      VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.

      They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the
      Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the
      collar, hauling him up on his feet.

      Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up
      on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>THUG #1</spk>
                 I owe you some pain.</sp>

      <sd>With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his
      gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just
      clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.

      The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,
      and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.

      As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally
      (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.

      With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.
      He's having fun.

      AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -

      THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.

      BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out
      of the way, like a gnat.

      Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from
      the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.

      Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,
      and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword.

      With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.
      The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:

      A DISPLAY WALL -

      filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.
      (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.
      Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.

      THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug
      #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.

      NEW ANGLE -

      Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond
      backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.
      (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)

      Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the
      last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from
      killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.

      As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A
      studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)

      Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN
      TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.

      Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the
      wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM
      THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  -

      In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1
      backwards, down onto the floor.

      AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -

      THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.

      BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE:

      THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM.

      And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE
      IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -

      NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV -

      The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still
      clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it.</sd>

                       (holstering the gun)

      <sd>And on this note, we -</sd>

      <sd>EXT. VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY -

      Under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white SEA DOLPHIN II sits at
      dock, festooned with pennants and banners. There's a crowd onboard.
      At the same time, however, 500 feet away...

      INT. DOCKSIDE CAFE -

      Bond meets with Signore DiGIACOMO, a middle-aged Italian Intelligence

      <sd>Bond stands to leave. DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's
      savoring some private secret. He snaps his fingers to an underling:</sd>

      <sd>THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      As Bond makes his way up the gangplank -

      ELLIOT HARMSWAY is holding a press conference near the bow, surround-
      ed by dignitaries. He is a man with an EVIL EUPHORIA - showing off
      all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most
      powerful media tycoons.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>
                 ...And so, it's somewhat fitting that
                 we are here today... To christen this
                 environmental research boat in Venice -
                 - 'Venezia' - the port where Marco
                 Polo sailed forth to explore the
                 world's great uncharted oceans...
                       (beat)
                 That 2/3 of the earth's surface where
                 the sharks are not working members of
                 the press.</sp>

      <sd>Laughter. Bond studies the man. Harmsway continues, pointing to a
      LARGE DRILL/BORING OBJECT, the size of a jet engine, attached to a
      long flexible hose/tube.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              With our six custom designed sea-bed
                 coring drills, we will probe the

                 sonars, radars, and research labs
                 will study the wind, the water, and
                 the sea life that so dearly feeds us.</sp>

      <sd>Bond moves through the crowd. He spots a bulkhead, with a door.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              And so, in the spirit of international
                 cooperation - thanking my good friend,
                 Valentin Zukofsky - the newly elected
                 President of the Ukraine for all his
                 assistance -</sp>

      <sd>He motions to Zukofsky, who nods to the audience...</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I give this boat to mankind - selflessly
                 - in pure charity asking nothing for
                 myself... But the cable TV rights.</sp>

      <sd>Big laugh from the assemblage. Harmsway turns to a BEAUTY QUEEN:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Miss Venice? If you'll do the honors -</sp>

      <sd>SMASH! She cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow. CHEERS!</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Now I'll take some questions from the
                 press - even the few of you who
                 aren't on my payroll.</sp>

      <sd>Laughter. Harmsway points to a reporter:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>REPORTER #1</spk>
                 Mr. Harmsway: Why did you name this

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Actually, my first choice was 'No
                 Comment.' So if someone asked where
                 I was, I could truthfully respond 'No
                 Comment.'
                       (laughter; he points)
                 Over there.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>REPORTER #2</spk>
                 Sir Elliot: Is it true you're in
                 negotiations to move your offices
                 from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (impishly)
                 No comment.</sp>

      <sd>Amidst more laughter, Bond disappears into the bulkhead door.

      INT. SEA DOLPHIN II - BELOW DECKS -

      Bond moves cautiously down a STAIRCASE...

      And peers along a CORRIDOR. He sees a GUARD, checking doors, making
      sure they're locked. Bond withdraws for a moment, looks back: The
      guard is at the far end of the hall. He lifts a WALKIE-TALKIE:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>GUARD</spk>
                 Level one, secure.</sp>

      <sd>The guard exits, down another staircase. Bond moves stealthily down
      the corridor, glancing at signs on various doors: FISH HATCHERY,
      WEATHER STATION, CREW'S MESS, etc... Until he comes to:

      METALLURGY LAB. There's a CARD READER by the door. Bond slips out
      his Q-toy, swipes it. Click. He goes inside.

      INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - CONTINUOUS

      Bond clocks the lab: Power tools, test benches, a SECOND ENTRY
      DOOR... And in the middle of the room -

      THE RED BOX.

      Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard
      through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking
      for tamper-proof seals. Finds none. Gingerly, he opens it:

      URANIUM SLUGS. They look like black tennis ball canisters.

      BOND presses a button on his watch: THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS WILDLY
      Bond pauses. Wants to make sure. He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER on
      a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result.

      Bond closes the box. He decides to check out the rest of the room -
      examining gadgets, tools, chemicals. HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -

      And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS, WITH ELONGATED TEETH.
      (They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside
      another )

      Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight. He wonders what it
      is used for. Just then -

      THERE'S A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR. Bond quickly replaces the
      cutting saw, moves to the first door -

      And as the SECOND DOOR OPENS, Bond slips out the first, into the
      CORRIDOR, down the hall, heading for the stairs.

      BACK IN THE METALLURGY LAB -

      YUNG enters, his hairless head shining under the lights. He looks
      around, sensing something is wrong. Glances: Not the red box. Not
      the Geiger counter. But then he notices it:

      THE DRAWER is sticking out, maybe a sixteenth of an inch.

      Yung picks up a telephone.

      SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -

      Bond emerges from the bulkhead door. The press conference wrapping
      up. As Bond makes his way to the RAIL, looking out on the cafe -</sd>

                       (sly glance to the thugs)
                 Or somebody else's business?</sp>

      <sd>The goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks
      a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck.

      A WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She
      is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SOFIA</spk>
                 Dimitri!!! You promised I could go
                 shopping!!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>                    (sotto, to Bond)
                 New mistress.
                       (to her, impatiently)
                 So? Go!</sp>

                              <sp><spk>SOFIA</spk>
                 I need money.</sp>

      <sd>Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>              Here. Take an inch.</sp>

      <sd>Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>              Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's
                 free.</sp>

      <sd>With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move
      several steps to the bar</sd>.

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>                    (to the bartender)
                 Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred.
                       (to Bond)
                 And you?</sp>

      <sd>Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his
      regular behavior might arouse suspicion.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            One.</sp>

      <sd>As the bartender pours:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I must say, Valentin, capitalism
                 seems to be treating you well.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>                    (belting one back)
                 I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes.
                       (then)
                 Off the record.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Of course. If you can't beat the
                 government, you might as well own it.</sp>

      <sd>Valentin spots someone off-camera.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>              Wait - I want you to meet a friend of
                 mine.
                       (calling out)
                 Elliot! Elliot! Come here.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway appears. Ebullient as ever.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>              Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce
                 you to an old friend -</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (putting out a hand to shake)
                 The name is Bond. James Bond.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Always nice to meet one of her
                 Majesty's fellow subjects...
                       (a nod to Valentin)
                 Especially one with such
                 distinguished friends.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            You might say I've always been one of
                 Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>                    (chortling)
                 'Biggest followers?' He's
                 practically made a career' of it!!</sp>

      <sd>He laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot.
                 Practically glows in the dark.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (smiles)
                 I can tell you're a man with an eye
                 for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.
                       (signaling off camera)
                 Darling! Come here.
                       (beat)
                 I want you to meet my wife.</sp>

      <sd>A woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As
      she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce
                 you to James Bond.</sp>

      <sd>There is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming
      his most insinuating smile:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              But then... I believe you two have
                 already met.</sp>

      <sd>There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then -

      POLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT!

      The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the
      gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI-
      TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>DiGIACOMO</spk>              Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices
                 of the Italian government, I, Franco

                       (pauses; smiles at a camera;
                        POP! A flash goes off)
                 Am arresting you for the illegal
                 possession of weapons grade enriched
                 uranium.
                       (to his underlings)
                 Seize the boat!</sp>

      <sd>A set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>VALENTIN</spk>              I think I suddenly remembered an
                 urgent meeting in Moscow.</sp>

      <sd>To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              My friends, there's been a terrible mistake.
                       (putting his arm around DiGiacomo)
                 Come. Let me show you.</sp>

      <sd>And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is
      left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Paris -</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't
                 it in our files?</sp>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>                   (anguished)
                 He didn't want anyone to know. He
                 kept it out of the papers. He said a
                 third wife was bad for his image.
                       (beat)
                 You've got to protect me!</sp>

      <sd>Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Go to my hotel room. I'll be there
                 in twenty minutes.</sp>

      <sd>Paris looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she
      wants to hear him say 'I love you.'</sd>

                           <sp><spk>PARIS</spk>             Just - say it. Say it just once.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (pauses, discomfited)
                 One thing at a time. I'll see you
                 in twenty minutes. Go.</sp>

      <sd>She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the
      SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him.

      INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I believe this is what you're looking
                 for, Colonel.</sp>

      <sd>He opens the red box. Hoists out a canister.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch -
                       (runs the Geiger counter over it)
                 It's depleted uranium! Completely
                 safe! A child could sleep on it.</sp>

      <sd>Bond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I received it from the Russian
                 government - a by-product of their
                 nuclear arms program - in the hopes
                 that I could create tools for
                 oceanographic research.
                       (beat)
                 It's what I was talking about:
                 'Swords into plowshares'! The Sprit
                 of International Cooperation!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>DiGIACOMO</spk>              Signore Harmsway. A thousand apologies.
                       (snaps his fingers to a lackey:)
                 Give him the video tape.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go
                 upstairs, and enjoy the reception.</sp>

      <sd>As the room empties, he calls -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute.</sp>

      <sd>Bond approaches him. They're the only people in the room.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (icily)
                 A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't
                 screw with a man who buys ink by the
                 ton.
                       (beat)
                 It's deadlier than uranium.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (staring him down)
                 We'll see about that.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway glances at his watch. Smiles coldly.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Aren't you late for a meeting?</sp>

      <sd>EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II/HARBOR - DAY

      Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            The Danielli. Presto!</sp>

      <sd>RETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB -

      Harmsway closes the door. Yung is there.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>
                 That was too close.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the
                 message. So will his boss.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a
      second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I'm going to the plane. Tell the
                 captain to set sail at once.</sp>

      <sd>EXT. THE DANIELLI HOTEL - DAY

      Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby.

      FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -

      Bond appears, rushing up a staircase. He comes to his doorway. It's
      closed, but unlocked.

      INT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM -

      Bond enters the room. Looks around, calling out -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Paris? Paris?</sp>

      <sd>He sees the French doors open onto the canal. The curtains billowing
      outward. Bond rushes to the window and looks down:

      EXT. GRAND CANAL - BOND'S POV

      Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Crushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>DiGIACOMO'S VOICE</spk>
                 Signore Bond?</sp>

      <sd>Bond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>DiGIACOMO</spk>              You're under arrest.</sp>

      <sd>THE SOUTH CHINA SEA - DUSK

      The HMS INDOMITABLE - a 3,300 ton British frigate, surges through the

      CLOSER -

      BATTLE-DRESSED ROYAL MARINES patrol the deck; GUNNERY CREWS man the

      INT. BRIDGE - DUSK

      Close on A VERTICAL GLASS MAP. An electronic panel display with a

                 Position?</sp>

      <sd>The GPS officer enters keyboard commands on console marked "GLOBAL

      <sd>The Captain is all business - clipped, sober terse. Turns to his

                 Captain leaving the bridge.</sp>

      <sd>The officers salute as he exits. With a shrug, the FIRST OFFICER

      <sd>EXT. MANOR HOUSE - THE COAST OF SCOTLAND - DAY

      THE BAGPIPE AND DRUM CORPS of the Royal Highland Regiment (aka the
      "Black Watch") is playing a FUNERAL DIRGE outside a vast stone house,
      with a HARMSWAY NEWS HELICOPTER on the lawn, and LIMOUSINES, A HEARSE
      and a FLOWER CAR in the driveway.

      SIX MEN IN FORMAL MOURNING ATTIRE are entering the house.

      INT. GRAND ROOM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE -

      A SINGLE WHITE ROSE is added to a pile of white roses in PARIS
      HARMSWAY'S OPEN CASKET.

      REVEAL: We're in mid-procession: The last two (of the six men from
      outside) place roses in the casket...

      Then turn, nodding sorrowfully to ELLIOT HARMSWAY (sitting in the
      front row of a room that's keen turned into a makeshift chapel)...

      And follow hand signals of STAMPER, who motions them THROUGH A DOOR,
      to an unseen room.

      After the last man has paid his respects, HARMSWAY stands, walks to
      the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single RED ROSE in his
      dead wife's casket.

      INT. HARMSWAY'S INNER SANCTUM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - DAY

      We're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a
      James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile. Steel, glass, chrome.

      The SIX men are seated around a giant conference table, looking
      absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire.

      Elliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein
      that hangs in the lobby of CAA,) walks to the head of the table,
      takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Good morning, Gentlemen. I'm sorry
                 to bring you here under these
                 circumstances, but
                       (beat)
                 Considering our meeting was already
                 scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.</sp>

      <sd>The men nod. Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk> (cont'd)
                 Number One, your report?</sp>

      <sd>A gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER ONE</spk>
                 Sir Elliot: The entertainment division
                 is releasing three new animated
                 children's movies this year.
                       (pause)
                 By the time we're finished promoting
                 them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper,
                 and magazine outlets -
                       (pause)
                 There won't be a parent in the universe
                 who won't feel guilty if they don't take
                 their children to our stores and theme
                 parks to buy the toys, books, video-
                 games and clothing featuring our
                 'lovable little creatures.'
                       (pause)
                 We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion
                 dollars.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Excellent, Number One. Build a better
                 rat-trap, and the world truly will beat
                 a path to your theme park.
                       (turns to)
                 Number Two?</sp>

      <sd>A young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER TWO</spk>
                 As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our
                 software division has introduced a new
                 computer operating system, Gates '99.
                       (beat)
                 It's deliberately filled with bugs -
                 so people will be forced to buy our
                 upgrades over the next five years.
                       (beat)
                 The window on revenues is 2.8 billion.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Outstanding, Number Two.
                       (beat, remembering:)
                 By the way - Number Five - ?
                       (a man looks up)
                 Who's ahead in the American elections?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER FIVE</spk>
                 The Democrat, sir. By nine points.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Maybe it's time to publish that story
                 about his sex life. Even things up.
                 A close race is always better for our
                 TV ratings.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER FIVE</spk>
                 Consider him slimed, sir.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Splendid. Next...
                       (with noticeable reserve)
                 Number Three. Your report?</sp>

      <sd>A SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands. Nervous.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER THREE</spk>
                 I regret to inform you, sir, that
                 Saddam Hussein is still demanding a
                 bonus for his role in the Gulf War.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ...Haven't we already paid him for his services?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER THREE</spk>
                 Yes, sir. But he still feels his
                 people should share in the increased
                 profits of our news division. He has
                 proposed an additional 500 million
                 dollar payment.</sp>

      <sd>A pause. The other men in the room shift uncomfortably.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ... And there's no truth that 10% of
                 that money will go into your Swiss
                 bank account?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER THREE</spk>
                 No sir! I swear! This is not true!!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              You disappoint me, Number Three.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway presses a button. Stamper enters. Number Three assumes
      this means death. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER THREE</spk>
                 Please sir. Please -</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ...But because I am a just man, I've
                 decided to give Mr. Hussein what he
                 deserves.</sp>

      <sd>Number Three is confused. Does this mean he's going to live?</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER THREE</spk>
                       (overwhelmed with gratitude)
                 Thank you sir! Thank you!</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway nods, watching him leave:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Good-bye, Mr. Azziz.</sp>

      <sd>And the man is gone. Harmsway turns his attention back to the room:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Let's proceed with new business.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway presses another button. The room darkens. The CENTER OF
      THE TABLE OPENS, and a 3-D MAP OF MALAYSIA rises into view.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we
                 are going to initiate phase one of
                 the word's most perfect crime: The
                 biggest theft in the history of mankind.
                       (beat, pointing with a laser)
                 Right here. In the Strait of Malacca.</sp>

      <sd>EXT. LIMOUSINE - MANOR HOUSE - DAY

      Stamper holds the back door open for Number Three. He gets in.

      INT. LIMOUSINE -

      He seems relieved, until the doors lock, ominously. They drive off.

      EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLAND ROADWAY - (INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - MOVING) DAY

      Number Three fidgets in the back... And notices Stamper smiling at
      him in the REARVIEW MIRROR. He sees Stamper reach INTO HIS JACKET -
      and PANICS! Is he going to get shot? Is it over? He winces, as -

      STAMPER'S HAND SUDDENLY THRUSTS BACKWARD THROUGH THE PARTITION.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              Gum?</sp>

      <sd>Shaking his head, he pulls out a HANDKERCHIEF to mop the flop sweat.

      RETURN ON THE MANOR HOUSE - FAVORING THE HNN HELICOPTER -

      Amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,)
      Harmsway gets in the waiting HNN chopper. It powers up, takes off.

      EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - SCOTLAND -

      Stamper's limousine parks near a Gulfstream jet. He opens the back
      door for Number Three. At last, the man believes he is safe.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>NUMBER THREE</spk>
                 Thank you! Thank you so much. You
                 must thank Sir Elliot for me.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>                    (producing a NEWSPAPER)
                 Here. Something to read on the plane.</sp>

      <sd>Stamper TUCKS THE PAPER FIRMLY UNDER #3'S ARM - and gives him a
      friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs.

      At the doorway, Number Three looks back. Stamper smiles, waving:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              Bye-bye.</sp>

      <sd>INT. GULFSTREAM JET - DAY

      Number Three settles into his seat. The door closes; the engines
      wind up for take-off. He sighs: He's safe. He casually picks up the
      newspaper, snaps open the front page:

      INSERT FRONT PAGE OF HARMSWAY'S "TOMORROW' NEWSPAPER:

      Screaming headline: ISRAELI AGENT REVEALED. There's a FULL COLOR
      PHOTO OF NUMBER THREE underneath.

      Number Three lowers the paper, white as a ghost, and -

      TWO ARABIAN GENTLEMEN (in full burnoose) sit down on either side of
      him. They smile. And on NUMBER THREE'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM, we</sd>

                                                                   CUT TO:

      <sd>THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE -

      Moving through FOG in the STRAIT OF MALACCA, night.

      INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

      The room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the Indomita-
      ble's command and control systems.

      At the VERTICAL GLASS MAP, the ship's course has been charted from
      Hong Kong, south, down around Singapore, then north, where the YELLOW
      BLINKING dot indicates it's currently in the Strait of Malacca.

      Standing in front of the map, however, THE NAVIGATION OFFICER seems
      perplexed. He's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper
      in his hand. Something is wrong.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>NAVIGATION OFFICER</spk>
                 ... This doesn't make sense. What's
                 our heading now?</sp>

      <sd>THE HELMSMAN looks down at his compass/auto-pilot.

      INSERT COMPASS/AUTO-PILOT - moving from West to North - then holding
      on a North position.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>
                 Zero one three. Due north.</sp>

      <sd>The two officers share a look. Something is odd, but -</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>
                 We're on course again.</sp>

      <sd>Just then, the FIRST OFFICER ENTERS from the exterior bridge.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>FIRST OFFICER</spk>
                 Can't see a damn thing in this fog.
                       (calling out)
                 Rating: What have we got?</sp>

      <sd>He joins the RATING and COMMUNICATION'S OFFICERS at their scopes.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>RATING</spk>
                 A passenger ferry and two freighters

                       (joining him)
                 What's wrong?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>
                 About every ninety seconds, the auto-

                 Check it again. What about the global

      <sd>EXT. SPACE -

      As the earth turns below, a TINY SILVER DOT appears in the distance:
      A COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE, spinning slowly on its axis.

      It comes closer and closer to camera, until it FILLS THE SCREEN, and

                              <sp><spk>FIRST OFFICER</spk>
                 How is it now?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>              Seems to be back to normal, sir.</sp>

      <sd>The First Officer nods... Then HEARS a SHRILL WARNING BEEP</sd>.

                              <sp><spk>SONAR OPERATOR</spk>
                 I have something off the port bow!</sp>

      <sd>The First Officer rushes to join him at the screen.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SONAR OPERATOR</spk> (cont'd)
                 100 meters out, just below the surface.
                       (adjusts the controls)
                 A meter in diameter; ten - twelve
                 meters long. ...Floating vertically?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>FIRST OFFICER</spk>
                 A dead head.
                       (off the others' quizzical looks)
                 Water logged timber. Floats straight
                 up. You sometimes see them on the east
                 side of the channel - from the logging
                 camps on Sumatra - but they don't
                 usually float this far west.
                       (calling out)
                 Muncy! Engines to half!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>              Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>FIRST OFFICER</spk>
                       (explaining)
                 Chew up a log like that in the
                 propeller, you end up with enough paperwork
                 to go from here to London. Twice.</sp>

      <sd>EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

      The ship is moving towards a DARK VERTICAL SHAPE - Harmsway's SEA-BED
      CORE BORING DRILL (shorthand "THE WORM',) attached to a long flexible
      dredging pipe.

      CLOSER - THE HEAD OF THE WORM -

      Motionless, hanging in the water. Then the monster awakes: A metal
      sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle CAMERA LENS.

      INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

      The Communications Officer reacts to his monitor with ALARM:

      COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
      I'm getting an electrical emission,
      sir! Extremely close. Bearing 240 -

      The First Officer is surprised. All hell is about to break loose:       -</sd>

                 That's impossible! We're in the

                 The log is moving!</sp>

      <sd>EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

      Propelled by water-jets in its head, THE WORM STREAKS TOWARD THE
      INDOMITABLE, emitting a HIGH PITCHED whine as its drill bit revs up
      to speed. The drill's BLACK TEETH glisten in the water.

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, NIGHT)

      Closing in on the hull like a torpedo. It gets closer, picking up
      speed, until - on IMPACT -

      INT. ENGINE ROOM -

      A TORRENT OF WATER engulfs the Engineer and Crewmen when The Worm
      bursts/drills through the hull. As they scream, drowning -

      A CREWMAN ON THE GANTRY scrambles up, one step ahead of the water,
      through a bulkhead, into -

      GENERATOR ROOM - (CONTINUOUS)

      Where the CREWMAN and TWO OPERATORS struggle to CLOSE THE DOOR
      AGAINST THE WATER.</sd>

                 <sd>It's the Captain -

      PASSAGEWAY #1 -

      On a phone, outside the ship's GYM, deep in the hull:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>THE CAPTAIN</spk>
                 What the hell is going on?!?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>THE CAPTAIN</spk>
                 On my way!</sp>

      <sd>He speeds along the passageway, going through a water-tight door,
      slamming it behind him. Meanwhile, on -

      THE BRIDGE -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>              The engines are gone!</sp>

                 Sound the general alarm! Seal all

                 Attention all hands -</sp>

      <sd>CREW'S MESS -

      The crew members look up from their meals -</sd>

                 Proceed to emergency stations -</sp>

      <sd>GENERATOR ROOM -

      The men have closed the door, but... HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED WHINING,
      GRINDING SOUND from the other side. They exchange a quizzical look;
      they don't know what to make of it, when:

      BANG! The door explodes inward - and a high-pressured stream of
      water blasts in, blowing them back against the walls.

      BRIDGE -

      The lights go out! Everyone is scrambling:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SYSTEMS OFFICER</spk>
                 We've lost power!</sp>

                              <sp><spk>FIRST OFFICER</spk>
                 Go to back up generators!</sp>

                              <sp><spk>SECOND OFFICER</spk> (into intercom)
                 Repeat: Seal all compartments, and -</sp>

      <sd>CREW'S MESS -

      In the dim lighting -</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SECOND OFFICER</spk> (on intercom)
                 Proceed to emergency stations at once!</sp>

      <sd>The men start to move, but halt at A HUMMING SOUND. They look
      around: Where is it coming from?

      Suddenly a THREE FOOT SECTION OF THE DECK EXPLODES IN A FOUNTAIN OF
      WATER. The men are swept off their feet.

      PASSAGEWAY/GANTRY #2 -

      As the Captain rushes up the steps, he turns around, reacting to a
      GRINDING NOISE -

      CAPTAIN'S POV - THE CLOSED WATER-TIGHT DOOR -

      BOOM! Water blasts through, like 1000 fire hydrants turned on full.

      With terror in his eyes, THE CAPTAIN sprints up the rest of the
      stairs, through a water-tight door, into:

      PASSAGEWAY #3 -

      Where the Captain secures the door behind him, and rushes away.

      THE BRIDGE -

      A desperate battle continues:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>DAMAGE CONTROL</spk>
                 Flooding on C-Deck!</sp>

                 Where the hell are those generators?</sp>

                 Get those pumps working!</sp>

      <sd>BATTERY ROOM -

      A CREWMAN hurriedly flips switches. The lights flicker... And just
      as they some to life, brightly -

      THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN, and a wall of water and debris blows in,
      destroying everything in its wake.

      THE BRIDGE -

      Lights out! A sense of helplessness is beginning to fill the room:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SYSTEMS CONTROL</spk>
                 The back-up is gone!</sp>

                 Flooding up to B-Deck!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>              We can't hold out much longer, sir!</sp>

      <sd>All eyes are on the First Officer. Will he save them?</sd>

                              <sp><spk>FIRST OFFICER</spk>
                 Where the hell is the Captain?!?!</sp>

      <sd>THE CAPTAIN (PASSAGEWAY #3) -

      Running, the Captain is about to reach the exit door. Hearing the
      relentless grinding behind him, he throws a look over his shoulder:

      BAM! The entrance door EXPLODES in a thunderball of water.

      The Captain clambers through the exit door to:

      PASSAGEWAY #4 -

      A short hall: He shuts the entrance door, runs to the exit. He
      looks hack again:

      BAM! The door blasts open - and the torrent of water continues the
      chase, as if it's got a personal vendetta against him. He exits to:

      PASSAGEWAY #5 -

      Slamming the door behind him, the Captain looks ahead, and up:

      STAIRS. AN OPEN DOOR AT THE TOP.

      He throws a look back:

      THE ENTRANCE DOOR IS BEGINNING TO HUM AND VIBRATE.

      Sprinting for his life, the Captain rushes up the stairs, two at a
      time. The humming behind him grows louder. He glances back:

      THE DOOR BLASTS OPEN. WATER SHOOTS IN.

      He rushes up the last four steps, just as -

      CA-CHUNK! THE EXIT DOOR SLAMS CLOSED IN FRONT OF HIM!

      With PANIC IN HIS EYES, the Captain turns to face the oncoming
      tsunami! We cut to:

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY #5)

      Moving like a shark... Toward THE CAPTAIN'S LEGS, DEAD AHEAD IN THE
      WATER. As it closes in for the kill -

      THE BRIDGE -

      Shifts, suddenly, to the stern. A confusion of anxious voices:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HELMSMAN</spk>              Slipping to stern!</sp>

                              <sp><spk>DAMAGE OFFICER</spk>
                 All major compartments flooded!</sp>

      <sd>With all hands still awaiting orders -

      THE ROOM LURCHES AS THE BOW RISES! Papers fly! Men slide! The
      First Officer has no choice:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>FIRST OFFICER</spk>
                 Abandon ship! Break radio silence!
                 Send our position!</sp>

      <sd>INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN -

      The Communications Officer types: "Top Secret. Indian Ocean Naval

                       (reading off his screen)
                 One hundred degrees, thirty-one
                 minutes, and seven seconds East, by

                 seconds, North.</sp>

      <sd>As he types, the room lurches again, tilting more to the stern.

      THE CAPTAIN - (STAIRCASE, PASSAGEWAY #5)

      As the passageway shifts, tilting to the stern, the Captain screams
      and WHOOSH! - is sucked down into the water - the worm's vortex -
      like meat being fed into a Cuisinart: A churning, spinning death.

      EXT. THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - FOG - NIGHT

      Bow rises completely out of the water as the stern goes under.

      EXT. DECK -

      TWO CREWMAN manage to get a LIFEBOAT away. TWO OTHERS scramble up
      from below and leap into the water.

      WIDER

      The bow is at a forty-five degree angle... And the H.M.S.
      Indomitable pauses - for just a moment - before SLIPPING UNDER, STERN
      FIRST, throwing up a series of great waves.

      EXT. LIFEBOAT -

      Rocked by waves from the sinking ship. The Cook, a Marine, and Three
      Crewmen hear a splash along side. Two of the Crew pull the SONAR
      OFFICER aboard. He takes a minute to catch his breath, then:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SONAR OPERATOR</spk>
                 Six. That's it? Only six of us?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>COOK</spk>
                 Most of the crew never made it to
                 their life jackets. The Captain?</sp>

                       (shrugs, then:)
                 The First officer stayed on the bridge.</sp>

      <sd>One of the CREWMAN SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>CREWMAN</spk>
                 Hey - look! Over there!</sp>

      <sd>NEW ANGLE - (ROCK OUTCROPPING - STRAIT OF MALACCA - NIGHT)

      The SEA DOLPHIN II emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white
      apparition in the fog.

      RETURN ON THE LIFEBOAT -

      The men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved.

      CLOSER ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - DECK -

      Elliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face. Turns to
      YUNG, standing next to him at the rail:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it?</sp>

      <sd>Yung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy. Oblivious, Harmsway looks at
      his WATCH, then looks through the BINOCULARS again - and begins to
      WHISTLE the opening notes of My Fair Lady's "WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY."
      ("All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air")

      THE LIFEBOAT -

      As the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just
      below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed.

      He hears the hum. His eyes follow the churning water...

      And suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from
      below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air.

      THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling. Stamper appears, hands
      Harmsway a piece of paper.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              We've decoded their last transmission.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles.</sd>

                       (then)
                 Time for phase two. You can get the
                 men in the water.</sp>

      <sd>And with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling
      "Wouldn't It Be Loverly."

      Stamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>
                 You heard him. Get the men in the water!</sp>

      <sd>NEW ANGLE - SIDE OF THE SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT -

      In the water next to the chip, FOUR DIVERS drop the last of their
      equipment in a DIVE BOAT. They cast off, motoring into the fog.

                 Good evening. I've just spoken with
                 the Prime Minister at the economic
                 summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a
                 full update within the hour.

                 For those of you still unaware, some

                       (all turn to him:)
                 I must formally protest this meeting.
                 Given the nature of what's occurred -
                 and the need for secrecy - I see no
                 reason to involve the air force, the
                 army, or MI-6.
                       (beat, as M and Tanner exchange a look)
                 This is an internal affair that should
                 be handled strictly by the officers of

                 As I was saying: Approximately forty-
                 five minutes ago, we received an abandon
                 ship signal from the H.M.S. Indomitable.
                       (flicks on a map display)

                 just south of Kuala Lumpur, where she
                 broadcast her last position.</sp>

                                                                  CUT TO:

      <sd>Harmsway and Yung look over his shoulder at:

      INSERT - VIDEO SCREEN -

      Through the worm's UNDERWATER camera, FOUR DIVERS with TORCHES and
      WELDING TOOLS are about to enter the HOLE in the Indomitable's hull.

      (The video screen also contains lots of digital information about the
      divers and the worm's functions.)

      NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - EXT. INDOMITABLE

      The worm follows the Divers into the hull.

      WORM POV - INT. ENGINE ROOM -

      It trails the Divers past debris and bodies of crewman.

      <sd>The Divers react, and the worm follows them into...

      PASSAGEWAY - UNDERWATER - NEUTRAL POV - INT. INDOMITABLE -

      The Divers and worm travel to a HATCH COVERED WITH METAL BARS.

      Lighting the welding torches, they try to cut through the metal
      bars... Unsuccessfully.

      VIDEO SCREEN - WORM POV -

      One of the Divers turns to the worm's camera. He SPEAKS into his
      diving helmet's microphone:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>DIVER</spk>
                       (through speaker)
                 It's titanium. we can't cut through.</sp>

      <sd>INT. SEA DOLPHIN BRIDGE -

      Stamper turns to Harmsway:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              I'll do it.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk> (into microphone)
                 Divers, stand aside.</sp>

      <sd>NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - PASSAGEWAY -

      The worm moves into position to grind through the hatch. A protective
      cover slides over the lens, and the grinder whorls into life.

      CLOSER ON THE WORM - The grinder stalls for an instant as it
      encounters the titanium bars.

      STILL CLOSER - One of the URANIUM GRINDING TEETH SNAPS OFF as it hits
      the titanium, and starts to grind through.

      NEW ANGLE

      Once past the bars, the grinder cuts easily through the steel door.
      Trapped air bursts out from inside the compartment. The Divers push
      the worm to one side; two of them enter the hold with lights. The
      worm follows. The two other divers remain behind to feed the worm's
      flexible tubing through the door.

      INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

      The Divers' lights illuminate the hold: STACKS OF GOLD BARS, as far
      as the eye can see.

      INT. BRIDGE - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Harmsway looks at the video screen.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Gentlemen: I do believe we've struck
                 gold... Four minutes ahead of schedule.</sp>

      <sd>INT. BILGE HOLD - UNDERWATER -

      The worm closes its "eye", revs up its grinders, and attacks the
      first pile of gold Bars. It runs through them like butter.

      Harmsway walks along the side of the ship, observing the operation:

      The WORM'S DREDGING PUMP sucks up the ground-up GOLD AND WATER SLUR-
      RY, (through the TUBE hanging over the side,) and dumps it into a
      SERIES OF SLUICES. At each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom
      of the sluice, and excess water flows off the side of the ship.

      AT THE STERN HOLD -

      where all the water has been drained off, leaving a cascade of gold
      nuggets pouring into the ship's hold -

      HARMSWAY reaches into the shimmering cascade, and takes a hand-full

                 I think I've just seen my next future

      <sd>Wade scowls, setting the boat back on course.

                 Captain Cheong's ferry was late. He

                 mill workers coming back for the

                 on the docks. Hundreds of them.</sp>

      Palm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces.

      INT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

      A local band plays on the verandah. We find Wade at a POKER TABLE
      with five local Malay Chinese. He CUTS THE CARDS, exuberantly:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>WADE</spk>
                 Okay gentlemen. The name of the game
                 is 7-card Cambodian stud. Everything
                 is wild!</sp>

      <sd>And then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find Bond, in a
      white dinner jacket, sitting with CAPTAIN CHEONG. The Captain is
      elegant, mid-5O's, eye patch. (To be put into local dialect.)</sd>

                              <sp><spk>CAPTAIN CHEONG</spk>
                 In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat
                 is even five minutes late, one begins
                 to worry, Mr. Bond.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I know. Pirates from Sumatra want
                 the cargo; smugglers from Thailand

                 The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles
                 off-course that night. Captain blamed
                 the auto-pilot; I suspected he was
                 drunk - until the Sumatra ferry
                 captain had same problem.</sp>

                 Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch.
                 Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody

                              <sp><spk>CAPTAIN CHEONG</spk>
                 Him? He, is a she -

                 at the bar.</sp>

      <sd>NEW ANGLE - THE BAR -

      SIDNEY WINCH, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,)
      beautiful, is ordering a drink when Bond appears:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SIDNEY</spk>
                 Bourbon. Neat.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I wonder if you handle your liquor
                 more carefully than you handle your boat.</sp>

      <sd>Very slowly, Sidney turns to Bond. She looks him up and down - as if
      deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. Her conclusion: A
      definite - though skeptical - maybe. She gives him a sultry smile:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>SIDNEY</spk>
                 Sometimes, you just have to plunge

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            This afternoon. Our boats practically

                 James Bond.</sp>

                 Sidney Winch.</sp>

                 No. But you can buy a drink for my

      <sd>She steps back REVEALING a huge SAMOAN, TARO, wearing a dark suit and
      tie, sitting on a stool. Taro smiles menacingly at Bond.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Boyfriend?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Pity.
                       (to Bartender)
                 Bring him whatever he wants.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur,

                 Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage?
                 Running from some poor little girl

                 London?</sp>

      <sd>Bond analyzes the situation: 1) She's with a thug. 2) She's in marine
      salvage. 3) She went to the Harbor Master's office for the charts.
      4) She's a smart-ass. He decides to see if he can rattle her:</sd>

                 And exactly what business are you in,
                 Mr. Bond?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Insurance. Lloyds of London.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>                    (daggers in her voice)
                 The Strait can be a very dangerous
                 place, Mr. Bond. A few words
                 scribbled on a piece of paper in
                 London doesn't carry a lot of value
                 out here. Including life insurance.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I'll keep that in mind.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>                    (looking off)
                 I see my date is here.
                       (to Taro)
                 And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Nice to run into you again.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Let's not make it a habit.</sp>

      <sd>She exits. Turning his back on Taro, Bond watches her cross the
      room. Taro places a huge hand on Bond's shoulder -</sd>

                              <sp><spk>TARO</spk>
                 I think you should go -</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Not quite yet, Taro -</sp>

      <sd>And from BOND'S POV - Sidney greets HARMSWAY with a big hug.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Uncle Elliot!!</sp>

      <sd>Watching this, Bond seethes with memory of Paris and his hatred of
      Harmsway. Taro tightens his grip -</sd>

                              <sp><spk>TARO</spk>
                 I said you should -</sp>

      <sd>But before he finishes, Bond spins, and: 1) slams Taro's head on the
      bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks Taro back-
      ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through Taro's tie into the
      wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon.

      Taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking.

      Bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie. Wade appears,
      jubilant, with a wad of cash:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>WADE</spk>
                 Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            He tied one on.</sp>

      <sd>EXT. A DESERTED MARINA - MORNING -

      Bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat, moored at the end.

      EXT./INT. BOAT AT MARINA - MORNING -

      Bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean-
      going craft. On the aft-deck, there's a large covered object.

      As Bond reaches for the CABIN DOOR, it opens by itself - and a
      succession of THREE YOUNG ENGLISH WOMEN in STRING BIKINIS emerge.</sd>

      <sd>STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

      Clear skies and blue water. The only vessel in sight is a thirty-
      five foot SPORT FISHING BOAT underway at full throttle.

      EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT, FLYING BRIDGE - DAY -

      Wade at the helm; Bond next to him, near sonar, holding Q's map.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Slow down. We're close.</sp>

      <sd>Wade pulls back on the throttle.

      AERIAL - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/STRAIT OF MALACCA) - DAY -

      The boat starts a wide turn -

      NEW ANGLE - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/ROCK OUTCROPPING/STRAIT) - DAY -

      And we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The
      SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches
      and the lush green hills of Sumatra.

      FLYING BRIDGE -

      Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>WADE</spk>
                 I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out
                 here. How could they get this far

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (concentrating on the sonar)

                          <spk sex="M">WADE</spk>              They'd never sail this close to the shore.

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Wait a minute -
                       (beat, pointing to the
                        screen)
                 I've got it. There! Off the port bow!</sp>

      <sd>INSERT SONAR SCREEN -

      The murky electronic outline of a ship.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Bond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts.</sd>
      
                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Cut the engines! It's about two-
                 hundred fifty feet down.</sp>

                                                              JUMP CUT TO:

      <sd>AN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) -

      By Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="M">WADE</spk>              Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I'll make a bounce dive. If I can
                 keep my bottom time short, I'll be

      <sd>Bond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (only half teasing)
                 Keep your eye out for pirates.</sp>

      <sd>Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="M">WADE</spk>              I got you covered.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            That's reassuring.</sp>

      <sd>Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears.

      UNDERWATER -

      Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward,
      handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.

      UNDERWATER BOTTOM -

      Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.
      Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.

      EXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER -

      Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand.

      Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color.
      From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being
      lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge.

      INSERT GAUGES -

      Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to
      study the damage. Then enters.

      INT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER -

      Bond sees the damage on the passageway door. Swims through it.

      INT. PASSAGEWAY - UNDER WATER -

      The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the
      busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made
      by the worm. He drops into the hold.

      INT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER -

      The gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty
      space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another.

      As he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch.
      He moves toward it.

      NEW ANGLE - CLOSER -

      A half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead.
      Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold.

      Just as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the
      brace, baring its teeth.

      Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into:

      PASSAGE WAY -(INT. INDOMITABLE) - UNDER WATER -

      where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling.
      Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see:

      THE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll-
      ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD
      BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare.

      CLOSE ON HATCH/DECK -

      Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover.
      He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs
      it into his sack, and swims off.</sd>

                                                                   CUT TO:

      <sd>UNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR -

      Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the
      way, he glances at his gauges:

      INSERT GAUGES -

      Depth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below RED LINE - empty. The ambient
      light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS.

      BOND LOOKS UP TO THE SURFACE -

      HIS POV -

      A black HULL has blotted out the light... And SOMETHING LARGE AND
      HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007.

      BOND -

      kicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks
      by. He looks up again:

      THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER.

      One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a
      CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007.

      BOND -

      Realizes his best chance is to take one of the men hostage.

      Flashing his KNIFE, Bond cuts the cord to his gold/uranium sack,
      STUFFS THE SACK INTO HIS BAGGY SWIM TRUNKS.

      Bond rockets up, SLAMMING INTO DIVER #1. A confusion of bubbles.

      And just as Bond overcomes the man - spinning him around, holding the
      knife to the diver's throat -

      DIVER #2 SHOOTS the HARPOON-TYPE GUN, and A DOLPHIN NET explodes out,
      ENVELOPING BOND AND THE DIVER in a mesh. (Note: This is a real,
      'fish friendly' research tool.)

      Diver #3 HOOKS THE CABLE he's been trailing onto the net, and -

      EXT. SEA -

      The net erupts through the surface, is hauled up into the air, and
      deposited on -

      THE DECK OF A SELF-PROPELLED SALVAGE BARGE.

      (An old scow, with a large crane, two-story deck-house, and a crew
      whose idea of 'cruise-wear' runs to tattoos and grotesque scars.

      BOND'S POV - THROUGH HIS DIVING MASK -

      As the water drains from his mask, Bond sees the mesh being pulled
      away, and FIVE GOONS come into focus, training AUTOMATIC WEAPONS on
      him. (Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat.)

      One of the goons reaches forward, ripping off Bond's mask. 007 sees:

      TARO - (EXT. SALVAGE BARGE, DECK) -

      Brandishing an UZI at Bond, with a malevolent smile:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>TARO</spk>
                 Uzi beats knife.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ...Interesting point.</sp>
      
      <sd>Bond sticks the knife into the deck, and releases the hostage.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">TARO</spk>              Get him up. Take his belt.
                       (motioning to Wade)
                 Take the two of them to the Captain.</sp>

      <sd>The men grab Bond roughly, and shove him next to Wade.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">TARO</spk>              By the way. I almost forgot.
                       (smashing Bond)
                 I owed you one.</sp>

      <sd>Bond and Wade are frog-marched to the bridge, passing under the gaze
      of various cutthroat crew members. Wade is completely unfazed.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="M">WADE</spk>                    (sniffs the air)
                 Smell that Jimmy? Sea Kelp.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="M">WADE</spk>              Hey - it could be worse. At least
                 they speak English.</sp>

      <sd>Bond glances up at a crew member, SHARPENING A MACHETE, smiling.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ...Somehow, that's not reassuring.</sp>

      <sd>INT. BRIDGE - SALVAGE BARGE - DAY

      We're back in Bond-land: A high-tech control room, with lots of
      monitors and white-suited TECHNICIANS. Bond and Wade are pushed
      through the-door, followed by Taro and the two goons.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">TARO</spk>              Here they are, Captain.</sp>

      <sd>The "Captain" turns from a monitor: IT'S SIDNEY.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (to Wade)
                 You have to excuse Miss Winch: She

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              No?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            No. First, because I don't think
                 it's in your nature. And second,

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              So charming! So suave!

                          <sp><spk sex="M">WADE</spk>              So it was commitment!</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong
                 knows what's on that boat and I'm
                 claiming it. One-third of that gold is
                 mine.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            That's fine, but - even a little
                 London girl knows that one third of
                 nothing is still nothing.</sp>

      <sd>There's a flicker of doubt in her eyes. She turns to Taro:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Was he carrying anything?</sp>

      <sd>Taro holds up the BOND'S DIVING BELT, indicating 'nothing'. Angrily:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Search him.</sp>

      <sd>The men look at Bond - wearing only swim trunks. Nobody moves.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I hope so.</sp>

      <sd>Frowning, Sidney moves to Bond. As she REACHES INTO HIS TRUNKS, we
      cut to THEIR FACES. THEIR EYES ARE LOCKED ON EACH OTHER:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I hope you'll be gentle.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Think about mom.</sp>

      <sd>BOND WINCES. She's goosed him.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... Unusual technique.</sp>

      <sd>Returning to the WIDE SHOT, she opens the sack. SHOWS THE GOLD:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              And what do you call this?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            - The family jewels?</sp>

      <sd>She scowls, takes out the URANIUM TOOTH. Looks at it, blankly, and
      holds it out to a TECHNICIAN, who examines it.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              What is this?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>TECHNICIAN</spk>
                 ...I don't know. I'm not sure -</sp>

      <sd>Just then, a CREWMAN BURSTS IN:</sd>

                 Bring them.</sp>

      <sd>Taro motions with his Uzi for Bond and Wade to follow...

      But BOND hesitates, LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the URANIUM.
      007 wants to get it, but Taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle.

      EXT. MALACCA STRAIT - DAY

      A BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN

      <sd>Bond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both
      know what's coming next. There's a pause, then -

      THE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO.
      It's only a warning shot, but -

      EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and
      Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro,
      cowering on the boards.</sd>

                 Good for you, Miss Winch. You now

                 I know my rights. These are
                 international waters. The British
                 Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm
                 claiming it. Under international

                 Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard

      <sd>Harmsway is perched on a desk. In the background, THROUGH HIS OPEN

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -

      <sd>Harmsway hangs up; STAMPER is standing nearby. Harmsway throws a

      TOWERS, looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance.</sd>

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - STREET LEVEL - LATE AFTERNOON -

      <sd>Bond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp
      into an underground car park.</sd>

      INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - (HARMSWAY TOWERS) -

      <sd>Passing NEWSPAPER LOADING DOCKS (with trucks displaying both the
      "TOMORROW" and "HNN" logos, and HUM-VEES used by building security,)
      Bond pulls into the VALET AREA -

      Where a cheerful YOUNG PR WOMAN and VALET wait. Both wear the

                 Don't they all?</sp>

      <sd>She points to a spot near the loading docks. Bond drives off.</sd>

      INT. BOND'S CAR -

      <sd>Bond backs into the space, thinking about the (inevitable) quick get-
      away. He looks through the windshield, surveying the area.

      BOND'S POV - UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

      TWO BURLY SECURITY GUARDS (in Harmsway Blazers,) stand behind a
      bulletproof security desk. There's a METAL DETECTOR by the door.

      BACK TO SCENE (INT. BOND'S CAR) -

      Reaching inside his jacket, Bond REMOVES HIS GUN, and HIDES IT in a
      compartment under the dashboard.</sd>

      INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -

      <sd>The PR WOMAN joins Bond as he locks the car with the REMOTE CONTROL.</sd>

                              <sp><spk sex="F">PR WOMAN</spk>
                 Right this way.</sp>

      <sd>Following her through the metal detector, Bond scans the security
      devices at the guard's desk: Lots of cameras, sensors, and alarms.</sd>

      EXT. PRESSROOM OBSERVATION ARCADE -

      <sd>Bond and the PR Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with
      GLASS WINDOWS looking down into a mammoth NEWSPAPER PRINTING PLANT.</sd>

                 Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon
                 editions. If you'll just follow me -</sp>

      INT. PRESSROOM BALCONY -

      <sd>The NOISE FROM THE PRINTING PRESSES is deafening. Bond and the PR
      WOMAN walk down a METAL STAIRCASE to the pressroom floor, where -

      Harmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking
      with SEVERAL PRESSMEN - a fresh issue of "Tomorrow" outstretched in
      his hands.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (spotting Bond, yelling:)

      INT. DRESSING ALCOVE - OFF THE PRESSROOM -

      <sd>Harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from
      the press room to an elevator. There's a SINK in the room.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              It's funny, Mr. Bond. Of all the

                 much enjoyment as my newspapers.</sp>

      <sd>He moves to the sink to wash his hands. Turns on the faucets:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk> (cont'd)
                 Ironic, isn't it? In the age of TV, I
                 still can't get the ink out of my veins.</sp>

      <sd>Bond SMILES WRYLY, looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Yes... A man with ink in his veins,
                 and blood on his hands.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe... But decides to
      ignore it. He turns off the faucet, dries his hands -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              We print 31 newspapers here; another

      <sd>He pulls on his £2000 Saville Row suit-jacket.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... And how many of those newspapers
                 carried Paris Harmsway's obituary?</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway turns, and presses the ELEVATOR BUTTON. The doors open,
      instantly. HE SMILES:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              All of them, Mister Bond...
                       (motioning inside)
                 After you?</sp>

      INT. ELEVATOR -

      <sd>The doors close. Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling.
      Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Before I became involved with Paris,
                 she was always involved with the most
                 inappropriate' men...
                       (beat)
                 Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle
                 aged Peter Pans who only brought out
                 the worst in her.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I see.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I tried to save her. But she remained a
                 manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate
                 behavior... Delusions of grandeur.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I wonder if it runs in the family.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (bursts out in a laugh)
                 The only difference between a
                 psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is
                 the degree of success.</sp>

      <sd>He looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Still, I do miss her. I only wish

      <sd>Harmsway motions for Bond to exit. They step out into:</sd>

      INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY ("ROGUES GALLERY") - LATE AFTERNOON

      <sd>A short hallway lined with OIL PORTRAITS of Harmsway's ancestors.
      Double doors at both ends. (People passing through.) As they walk -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I call this the Rogue's gallery.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Yes. I can see: You've hung the

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (pointing to the first portrait)
                 My third great Uncle - the Earl of
                 Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of
                 Hong Kong from the Chinese.
                       (moving to)
                 His son-in-law - George Harmsway -
                 made the first family fortune,
                 running opium into Shanghai...
                       (moving to)
                 His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking
                 the opium...
                 And my grandfather Henry, who opened the
                 first telegraph station, and published
                 the colony's first English newspaper.
                       (pausing, wistfully)
                 It was a city of unlimited possibility.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            So why did you leave?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Because it's a dying city. Since the
                 Chinese take-over, who knows what can
                 happen tomorrow?
                       (moving to the last two portraits)
                 In any case, this is my father, Charles: A
                 royal bastard who started the first radio
                 and television stations. Said I'd never
                 amount to anything, but...
                       (passing his own portrait)
                 I turned it into this</sp>

      <sd>He pushes through a door, into:</sd>

      INT. HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON -

      <sd>A cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity. At the center
      is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK, (where a news broadcast is in progress,)
      surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la CNN.

      Around the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking out
      on Kuala Lumpur. All are broadcasting: A Larry King-type chat show;
      MTV; SPORTS; a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something flambeed.

      With its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect
      is overwhelming. Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.
                       (starting to walk)
                 Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his
                 legions; I have my divisions:
                       (pointing)
                 News, sports, business, entertainment.
                 And these are my foot soldiers:
                       (a wave of his hand)
                 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed
                 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87
                 magazines, and 29 different cable TV
                 channels - in 35 languages.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            And still not a thing to watch.</sp>

      <sd>He glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM, with a NASA-type WORLD MAP.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ...Although it must be fun to have

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (wryly)
                 Or disinformation... If you wanted to,

                 off course? Maybe one degree a minute?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (guffaws)
                 Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I
                 should buy it for a book! It's
                 totally preposterous, but -
                       (off Bond's reaction)
                 You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I
                 can amuse you.</sp>

      <sd>He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL. Begins to type.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Let's see... First we have this
                 James Bond... I believe he's a field

                 Not a bad title for that book...

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Who I believe they call "007."</sp>

      <sd>Bond is not amused. Harmsway is enjoying himself:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both
                 men of action. But your era is passing.
                 Words are the new weapons; satellites the
                 new artillery. And make no mistake about
                 it: In the right hands, they can be as
                 deadly as your Walther PPK.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ...Words to live by?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Your choice.
                       (glancing at his watch)
                 Look at the time! Come. There's
                 someone I want you meet - about a
                 story I'm thinking of publishing.</sp>

      <sd>As they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's "I don't care what
      you think you know - I can crush you" attitude... And now, Harmsway
      plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off
      the one other loose thread in his perfect crime:</sd>

      INT. HARMSWAY'S OFFICE -

      <sd>The DOOR opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond. He calls to
      someone we don't see:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Hello, dear. I'm sorry I took so long -</sp>

      <sd>REVEAL: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              That's okay, Uncle Ell -</sp>
      
      <sd>She freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond. Bond is equally surprised.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              What is HE doing here?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I see you two have met.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Briefly.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (crossing to his desk)
                 Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him
                 here hoping he might shed some light
                 on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of
                 London.'
                       (sly glance to Bond)
                 ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              He's not going to tell the truth! He
                 was diving for the gold!</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch
                 has told me the most incredible story: A
                 sunken British warship filled with gold;
                 a British cutter firing on her; billions
                 of dollars in bullion lying on the
                 bottom of the Strait.</sp>

      <sd>Bond isn't enjoying this charade.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Obviously, the British government
                 denies all of this -</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              - I told you! He was there! -</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              - But as I've explained to Sidney,
                 without proof, there's just no story.
                 Don't you agree Mr. Bond?</sp>

      <sd>Before Bond can answer -</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              But I have proof! You ran out of here
                 so fast, I didn't get to show you.</sp>

      <sd>Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway
      wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him
      the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill
      both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (forcing a smile)
                 ...And what's that, my dear?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -</sp>

      <sd>Sidney cuts Bond off, DROPPING THE GOLD BAR on Harmsway's desk.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              He brought that up from the wreck.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ...I see.</sp>

      <sd>Alarmed, Bond wants to stop Sidney from reaching into her bag again -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Sidney, I wouldn't -</sp>

      <sd>Too late. She drops the uranium tooth on his desk.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              And what about this? Any idea what this is?</sp>

      <sd>Silence. Harmsway and Bond exchange a sober look. Then:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ... I believe it's a depleted uranium
                 drill bit, my dear.</sp>

      <sd>HE PRESSES AN ALARM UNDER HIS DESK. Bond reaches for the DRILL TOOTH.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Why don't we just take these -</sp>

                 No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway stands, comes around the desk:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ...Well! I do believe this requires

                 says, I won't kill this story.

                 Miss Oxford will show both of you to
                 the elevator... And one of my people
                 will definitely be in touch sooner
                 than later.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I'm sure they will.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Good-bye, Mister Bond.</sp>

      <sd>He reaches to kiss Sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too long.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Good-bye, darling.</sp>

      <sd>Watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter.</sd>

      INT. ELEVATOR HALLWAY - DAY -

     <sd> As the Executive Secretary escorts them to the elevator, Bond glances
      out the PICTURE WINDOW, with its view of the other tower.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>EXECUTIVE SECRETARY</spk>
                 Thank you both for coming in...</sp>

      BOND'S POV - EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS -

      <sd>Five floors directly down is the GLASS-ENCLOSED SKY BRIDGE; just
      above him, he sees TWO WINDOW WASHERS being pulled up on a TWO MAN
      SCAFFOLD.

      BACK TO SCENE -

      A CHIME SOUNDS; the elevator doors open. Bond and Sidney ad-lib
      good-byes to the secretary and get in.</sd>

      INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

      <sd>Sidney presses the button for "1". Bond glances at the FLOOR INDI-
      CATOR with reads "55" - clocks the SECURITY CAMERA - and starts
      looking for an ESCAPE PANEL. Sidney watches out of the corner of her

                 ... Do you have a gun?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              What?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (yanking it down)
                 You heard me. A gun?
                       (disabling it)
                 I left mine in the car.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              That's funny: you struck me as the kind

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Listen to me! I'm a British secret
                 service agent. And we have about two
                 minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.</sp>

      <sd>He glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Has anyone ever suggested that you're
                 a paranoid psychotic?</sp>

      <sd>Bond ignores the insult, explaining as he moves under the panel:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Harmsway sank that ship and stole the
                 gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.

                 And thanks to your little show and tell -
                       (straining to open the panel)
                 - giving him the evidence -
                       (popping it open)
                 We're the only ones who can tie him
                 to the crime.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Maybe. But why are we going up
                 instead of down?</sp>

      <sd>He nods to the FLOOR INDICATOR. She looks: 60, 65, 70. IT STOPS.
      Bond reaches down to her -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Sidney, come with me -</sp>

      <sd>THE DOORS OPEN. She looks at his outstretched hand with disdain:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Not if my life depended on it.</sp>

      INT. 70TH FLOOR -- DAY

      <sd>Sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction. The elevator
      doors CLOSE behind her. To the right, she sees STAMPER and a
      Harmsway-blazered GUARD, with MACHINE PISTOLS.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Thank God! He's crazy!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              Does he have a gun?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              No.</sp>

      <sd>On Stamper's reply -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              Good -</sp>

      <sd>He lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her.
      She struggles, yelling:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              This is a mistake!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>                    (gun against her skull)
                 Shut up!</sp>

      <sd>Using Sidney as a HUMAN SHIELD, Stamper marches her in front of the
      closed elevator doors. The guard follows. THEY POSITION THEMSELVES
      FOR A MASSACRE. Reaching around Sidney, Stamper pulls out his RADIO:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk> (into radio)
                 Open 14.</sp>

      <sd>A beat. It opens. The men unleash a HAIL OF BULLETS, then realize -</sd>

      NEW ANGLE - (INT. ELEVATOR) -

      <sd>The car is empty. Stamper perplexed. Pushing Sidney in front of
      him, he enters the elevator, cautiously... When, suddenly:

      BOND SWINGS DOWN OUT OF THE ESCAPE PANEL (like an athlete on a high-
      bar) FEET FIRST - barely clearing Sidney's head as he KICKS Stamper
      and the Guard in their faces. They go flying backwards.

      Bond jumps down, grabs Sidney -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Need a lift?</sp>

      <sd>And boosts her into the escape panel, following her up.</sd>

      INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE THE ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) -

      <sd>Bond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as -

      STAMPER AND THE GUARD -

      Recover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and START RAKING THE
      CEILING WITH GUNFIRE.

      ELEVATOR SHAFT -

      Bond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to
      SHIELD HER as BULLETS RIP UP THE FLOOR behind them. With his free
      hand, Bond reaches up for the LATCH to open the door above them.</sd>

      INT. ELEVATOR -

      <sd>Stamper stops shooting. Moves to the rear of the cab, under the
      escape panel. Peers up. Sees nothing. Turns to the Guard:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              Help me up.</sp>

      <sd>ELEVATOR SHAFT -

      Stamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have
      disappeared into -</sd>

      INT. HALLWAY - (ELEVATOR BANK) - 71ST FLOOR.

      <sd>Squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately
      close behind them,) Bond and Sidney encounter a group of STUNNED
      OFFICE WORKERS, waiting for the elevator.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (to the office workers)
                 ... I'd try the stairs.</sp>

      <sd>As Bond and Sidney scamper off -

      RETURN ON STAMPER - IN THE ELEVATOR -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>                    (rushing out)
                 The stairs!
                       (barking into his RADIO)
                 Attention all units! They're on the
                 71st floor!</sp>

      INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY - ANOTHER PART OF THE BUILDING -

      <sd>Harmsway is striding towards the SECURITY CENTER, RADIO in hand:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Stamper! They're not to leave this
                 building alive!</sp>

      BOND AND SIDNEY - (INT. HALLWAY) -

      <sd>Moving cautiously toward a CORNER of ANOTHER HALLWAY.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              This has got to be a mistake.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            The only mistake is that they didn't
                 kill us in the elevator.</sp>

      <sd>At the corner, Bond STOPS, SEEING A GUARD, farther down the hall (his
      back to them) CHECKING DOORS.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Wait here.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              No. I'm going with you.</sp>

      <sd>Bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. They start doing a
      "DUCK AND COVER" in and out of doorways TO SNEAK UP ON HIM.</sd>

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

      <sd>Harmsway bursts in on GUARDS watching a WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Where are they?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>GUARD #1</spk>
                 I don't see them -
                       (scanning the monitors)
                 There!</sp>

      INSERT VIDEO MONITOR - (SURVEILLANCE SHOT OF HALLWAY) -

      <sd>Bond and Sidney have just come into frame, sneaking up on the GUARD.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk> (OVER)
                 Warn him!</sp>

      <sd>CLOSE ON THE GUARD - (INT. HALLWAY) -</sd>

                              <sp><spk>VOICE ON RADIO</spk>
                 Porter! They're behind you -</sp>

                              <sp><spk>GUARD</spk>
                       (lifting the radio to reply)
                 Roger! Over and -</sp>

      <sd>BAM. BOND DECKS HIM.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Out.</sp>

      <sd>Bond kneels, grabs the GUARD'S MACHINE PISTOL, and CLIPS, just as -</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              JAMES!</sp>

      <sd>TWO GUARDS have entered from a STAIRCASE DOOR, hoisting MAC-10's. In
      an instant: (1) Bond lets go a BURST. (2) The Guards SHOOT back,
      diving for cover in the staircase door. (3) Bond rolls, (4) Pushes
      Sidney into an open DOORWAY, and (5) returns A BURST, from -</sd>

      INT. SMALL KITCHEN/COPIER ROOM -

      <sd>Sidney is shaken. As Bond stands in the doorway, guarding them -</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Okay. So it wasn't a mistake.
                       (Bond lets go a blast)
                 What do we do now? Offer them
                 dinner?!?!</sp>

      <sd>Bond glances back at the KITCHEN SUPPLIES. GETS AN IDEA. He sud-
      denly TWISTS, SMASHING the BUTT OF HIS GUN down on some GLASSWARE on
      the counter, then TWISTS BACK, returning a BURST OF GUNFIRE.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Come here. You shoot. I'll cook.</sp>

      <sd>She thinks he's nuts, but squeezes next to him. Handing her the gun:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Aim that way.</sp>

      <sd>Sidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, BULLET HITS
      RIP UP THE DOOR FRAME. She jumps, TERRIFIED.

      Bond looks at her from the PHOTO-COPYING MACHINE, where he is YANKING
      OUT the TONER CARTRIDGE. He offers a simple piece of advice:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Shoot back!</sp>

      <sd>Sidney frowns... Turns... And as she LETS THE GUN RIP, we cut to:</sd>

      INT. STAIRWELL - (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING) -

      <sd>Stamper, running up steps with the guard. They exit into:

      A SHORT SERVICE HALLWAY - 71ST. FLOOR -

      They rush though it, bursting through a door into:

      THE ELEVATOR BANK HALLWAY -

      Stamper and the Guard start hunting Bond.

      RETURN ON SIDNEY (HALLWAY/KITCHEN) -

      As she continues to exchange fire with the guards...

      BOND, (having broken the toner cartridge open,) is DUMPING THE TONER
      in a coffee can. He reaches for a BOX of sugar</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            One second -</sp>

      <sd>And (with GUNFIRE SFX over,) Bond sweeps the BROKEN DISH into the
      can, and drops his Q LIGHTER in the mix.

      He moves to Sidney, in the doorway. Kneels. In-between shots:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... How did you get into marine
                 salvage?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>                    (gun burst, then)
                 My father left me the business.</sp>

      <sd>Bond glances at his watch, timing the bomb. The guards shoot; she
      shoots back, then explains:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              I used to be a divorce lawyer in New
                 York City.</sp>

      <sd>Bond nods, continuing to look at his watch. Glances at her:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Not a lot of difference.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              What do you mean?</sp>

      <sd>Bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Either way, you're taking the goods
                 from dead hulks.</sp>

      <sd>He tosses the can, and PULLS HER BACKWARDS, covering her.

      NEW ANGLE - THE HALLWAY -

      The GUARDS spring from the door, rushing forward to storm Bond's
      position - just as the COFFEE CAN rolls towards them, and EXPLODES.

      RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Let's go -</sp>

      <sd>Taking the gun, the two of them start for the door when -

      NEW ANGLE - OPPOSITE END OF THE HALLWAY - CORNER -

      Stamper and the GUARD have arrived at the corner, BLASTING.

      RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Damn!</sp>

      <sd>Swiftly, Bond grabs a JUG of CLEANER from under the sink, moves to
      the door, and ROLLS IT DOWN THE HALL in Stamper's direction.

      STAMPER AND THE GUARD - (HALLWAY CORNER) -

      Anticipate a bomb. They move back.

      BOND AND SIDNEY (INT. KITCHEN) -</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              What the hell does that do?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Cleans dirt. Let's go.</sp>

      INT. HALLWAY -

      <sd>Bond and Sidney BREAK for the STAIRCASE DOOR. (Where the first Guards
      were shooting at them from.) TWISTING AROUND, Bond lets a BURST go
      in Stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead
      guards' MAC-l0's.

      INSERT - BOND'S BULLETS RIP UP THE JUG OF CLEANER.

      BOND AND SIDNEY ESCAPE FROM THE HALLWAY -

      STAMPER -

      Cowers, waiting for the jug to blow up... Then realizes:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              It's a trick! After him.
                       (into his radio, on the run)
                 They're in the south stairwell!</sp>

      <sd>HARMSWAY, IN THE SECURITY CENTER -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Get more men up there!</sp>

      INT. STAIRWELL - LANDING -

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Down?</sp>

      <sd>Bond leans over the railing. Sees GUARDS coming UP. SHOOTS.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Up.</sp>

      <sd>They go up about three stairs, and Sidney sees GUARDS descending.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Down?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (shoots, then)
                 Up.</sp>

      <sd>Bond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a METAL DOOR, just as -</sd>

      INT. HALLWAY -

      <sd>Stamper and the Guard bound down the hallway, heading for the door.</sd>

      INT. SECURITY CENTER -

      <sd>Harmsway smiles, watching Bond on a monitor:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ... And so much for that.
                       (into radio)
                 They're on the 72nd floor set-back.
                       (explains to the guards)
                 Nowhere to go.</sp>

      EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TERRACE SETBACK - TWILIGHT -

      <sd>It's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback. Bond
      sees a WINDOW WASHER'S RIG. And although Sidney asks -</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Now what?</sp>

      <sd>Bond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them. Amidst
      a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. He
      grabs it, and -

      BANG. BANG. BANG. He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the frame.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            That should buy us some time.</sp>

      <sd>Now, Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - a two-man bucket-like
      scaffold ON TRACKS, with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside, and a
      LARGE CABLE SPOOL/MOTOR that stays on the roof.

      Approaching it, Bond looks over the side:

      BOND'S POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR -

      Twenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the
      ground. It's a long, long, way down.

      RETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Help me move this.</sp>

      INT. STAIRWELL -

      <sd>Darting up the few steps, Stamper and Guards arrive at the door. He
      tries to open it. Won't budge.</sd>

                 I'll call for a battering ram -</sp>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              No. Get the fire ax.</sp>

      <sd>One of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET. He hands the
      AX to Stamper, who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR.

      RETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Bond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            We'll go down close to the sky bridge.
                 We may be able to swing over and use it
                 for cover.</sp>

      <sd>As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              No way. I sail. I do not fly.</sp>

      <sd>BANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... Sometimes, you just have to take
                 the plunge.</sp>

      <sd>Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts
      down, as fast as they can go.</sd>

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL -

      <sd>Bond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset.</sd>

      INT. STAIRCASE -

      <sd>Stamper gives the last few chops to the door. He kicks it open.</sd>

      EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR -

      <sd>Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR -

      Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              All I know is one thing: If we get
                 out of here alive, that gold is mine.
                       (beat)
                 I've earned it.</sp>

      <sd>Looking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            One thing at a time.</sp>

      EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT -

      <sd>Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to
      the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY -

      And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of
      cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS.

      THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) -

      Swings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They
      are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant
      pendulum - although still descending.

      RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it.
      He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) -

      Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket.

      STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX -

      Finally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT.

      BOND AND SIDNEY -

      are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>                    (panicked, anxious, fast)

                 Trust me.</sp>

      <sd>And with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Let's go -</sp>

      <sd>But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY
      DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW.

      THE TERRACE SET-BACK -

      Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose
      from its moorings.

      BOND AND SIDNEY -

      look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what
      (she thinks) is certain death:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              We're going to bounce off that thing!</sp>

      <sd>Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper
      cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Hold on!</sp>

      <sd>TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -

      Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT-
      TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall,
      and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.

      THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG -

      Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall.

      BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge.

      THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS -

      BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO -</sd>

      INT. 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE -

      <sd>Landing on the deck of the bridge. Bond rolls to his feet as -

      Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck. Bond
      yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as THE CABLE DRUM,
      PULLEY, AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY.

      72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK -

      Looking down, Stamper flips open his radio.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>                    (over radio)
                 They're on the bridge. Seal off the

                 Get somebody up there!</s>

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

      <sd>Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              What about the elevators?</sp>

      <sd>He steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four
      inch pipe. Bond begins to work feverishly:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            We tried that already. Remember?</sp>

      <sd>Bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              You know, this is as much your fault
                 as it is mine.</sp>

      <sd>Bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe. One loop.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Sidney, we don't have time for this -</sp>

      <sd>He pulls on the loop to test it. Good enough. Makes a second loop.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Sure! Just when I want to talk -
                       (beat)
                 Not that I would have believed you -</sp>

      <sd>Bond tests the second loop. He's satisfied. Turns to her:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Put your back to the railing. Sit up
                 on it.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>                    (doing it)
                 Are you listening to me?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Put your arms around my neck. Lock

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              ... We have time for that?</sp>

      <sd>Just then, GUARDS APPEAR OUT OF FAR ELEVATOR DOOR. Running, THEY
      SHOOT. BOND FIRES A BURST BACK as - A NEW ROUND OF BULLET HITS
      BEGINS TO RAIN DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE.

      BOND LOOKS UP: Stamper has commandeered a second window washer's
      rig, and is descending, FIRING AT THEM.

      Bond looks at Sidney -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Sometimes you just have to -</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Don't say it.</sp>

      <sd>She locks her arms and legs around him, he snaps the leather harness
      around her waist, and they roll over the railing Amidst gunfire.</sd>

      EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - TWILIGHT

      <sd>Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up.

      They go down,

      And down,

      And down -

      RETURN ON THE RAILING - (INT. SKY BRIDGE) -

      The cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent; the
      PAINT ON THE RAILING IS BURNING OFF, and the STEEL itself is STARTING
      TO SMOKE from the friction.

      BOND AND SIDNEY - DROPPING -

      Dropping -

      And Dropping.

      Looking to the ground, Bond sees the PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY
      coming up fast from below. It looks like they're going to get
      splattered on the tile floor, when -

      RETURN ON THE RAILING - SKY BRIDGE -

      The cable comes to the end of its run! It DRAGS THE SPOOL, THE
      BUCKET, and all the other MECHANICS to the side of the bridge,
      SMASHING AGAINST THE WALL, JAMMING AGAINST THE RAILING.</sd>

      EXT. THE PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY - TWILIGHT -

      <sd>Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt. They're swinging about five feet
      from the balcony. There's a pause...</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Is this - like - a normal day for you?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            It's a lousy job, but -
                       (reaching for the balcony)
                 The only reason I stay is for the
                 health benefits.</sp>

      <sd>Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY.</sd>

      INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -

      <sd>Stamper lands on bridge. He unbuckles his harness, runs to railing,
      looks down and sees SIDNEY AND BOND climbing out onto the balcony,
      going for the PRESS ROOM DOOR.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>                    (into his radio)
                 They're heading for the press room.
                 Stop them!</sp>

      INT. PRESS ROOM -

      <sd>Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came down
      earlier to meet Harmsway.

      The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening.

      At the "start" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond
      sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE, about to be loaded.

      Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where
      Bond and Harmsway exited earlier. -

      Coming out of that DOOR, Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway Blazers
      carrying guns.

      BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL.

      It CRASHES TO THE GROUND, rolling backwards on the guards. As they
      start scrambling around it -

      Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc-
      tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...)

      They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN, with an oversized crowbar.

      Bond and the Pressman square off. Bond tries to get around him. The
      man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it. Bond tries to block the
      descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.

      Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing
      each other against the side of the press...

      Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and
      pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,
      Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -

      And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops
      him on the head with the crowbar.

      Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -

      But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out
      from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.

      Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard
      as he comes to finish Bond off.

      The Guard stumbles backward -

      Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. (A large machine that
      wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.)

      Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the
      BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that
      as Bond turns -

      The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.
      Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond
      ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) -

      Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,
      pulling Sidney away at the last moment.

      The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...

      The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            He was bad news.</sp>

      <sd>Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney
      and the gun, and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Down there!</sp>

      <sd>They jump into it, sliding down, and around an ALUMINUM CHUTE into:</sd>

      INT. GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS.

      <sd>Bond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers.

      Hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise -
      they're ready for almost anything, except what they HEAR:

      The SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING. A polite, almost bored clapping.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk> (O.S.)
                 Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding
                 performance.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a
      straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk> (continuing)
                 I'm the certain the British taxpayers
                 would be impressed by your efforts.
                 Don't you agree?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I think they'd rather know who stole
                 their gold.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway can't help his ego:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (chuckles)
                 Why, I did, of course. It's on the
                 Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside
                 of Hong Kong... Not that it will do
                 either of you any good to know.
                       (beat)
                 Now both of you: Stand up. And toss
                 the gun out, Mr. Bond.</sp>

      <sd>Bond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK
      TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH.
      Bond begins to scheme.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Uncle Elliot: How could you do this
                 to me?</sp>

      <sd>Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Oh, please, Sidney. There's a
                 hundred billion dollars at stake.
                       (beat)
                 Besides, I never really liked your
                 father that much. He cheated at cards.</sp>

      <sd>Bond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Are your guards really going to kill
                 a helpless girl?</sp>

                          <<sp>spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              My guards are from South Africa, Mr.
                 Bond. This is their chance to get even

                       (beat)
                 Now both of you. Put your hands on
                 your heads, and step forward.</sp>

      <sd>Holding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's
      manipulating the control into the right position to use it.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (trying to buy time)
                 What did you do, Harmsway? Make some

                 the gold?.. Was the radioactive
                 uranium I found in Venice part of it?</sp>

      <sd>He finally has the remote control in the right position.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Questions, questions, Mr. Bond...
                 Which I'm afraid I've neither the

                       (to the guards)
                 Take them out to the jungle and -</sp>

      <sd>Suddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in
      shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as:

      BOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the
      newspaper trolley, while -

      THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling.

      BOND takes his position with Sidney.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I forgot to mention: The job comes

      <sd>THE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot
      out the headlights, while -

      BOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same
      time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Here. You shoot. I'll drive.</sp>

                 And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.</sp>

      <sd>Bond eyes her for one split second. Points at the guards:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Aim that way.</sp>

      <sd>Sidney starts to shoot as -

      THE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car... But:

      THE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER.

      THE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS...

      THE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT.

      There's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS
      THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Ready? Now!</sp>

      <sd>The two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE.</sd>

      INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE -

      <sd>- Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning
      rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders.

      THE GUARDS -

      Continue to shoot at the car.

      OTHER GUARDS -

      Run for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase.</sd>

      INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      <sd>Bond flips open a hidden control panel. Flips a switch.</sd>

      EXT. BACK OF BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      <sd>The TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire.</sd>

      INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -

      <sd>Bond glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees the HUM-VEES. Presses
      another switch -

      CLOSE ON BOND'S EXHAUST PIPE -

      Whoosh! A MISSILE blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on -

      THE FIRST HUM-VEE.

      BOOM! It's decimated.

      ANGLE ON HARMSWAY - ON HIS RADIO -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Seal the garage! Cut the power!
                 He's got no headlamps!</sp>

      INT. GARAGE - FIRST TURN -

      <sd>As the car screeches around a corner, the overhead lights go out.</sd>

      INT. BOND'S CAR -

      <sd>Bond flips down the visor: A THERMAL IMAGING DISPLAY drops down.</sd>

      INSERT "HEADS UP" IMAGING DISPLAY -

      <sd>It looks just like the jet fighter videos from the Gulf War.</sd>

      INT. GARAGE - SECOND TURN - UP RAMP -

      <sd>Bond's car roars around a second turn, with sparks flying as it
      scrapes the walls. AHEAD, a MASSIVE ONE-PIECE DOOR is FOLDING DOWN
      FROM THE CEILING. A city street beyond.</sd>

      <sd>Bond flips down a control panel from the RADIO. A DIGITAL DISPLAY

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            If it's radio controlled, it'll break

                 We blast through.</sp>

      <sd>THE CAR APPROACHES THE CLOSING DOOR AT HIGH SPEED -

      BOND SEES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. HE PUNCHES THE MISSILE BUTTON.

      TWO MISSILES ROAR OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR -

      THEY EXPLODE AGAINST THE CLOSING DOOR - TO NO EFFECT.

      BOND'S CAR GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER -

      SIDNEY SCREAMS! BOND BRACES, AND -

      BOOM! CRASH! SILENCE. BLACK. After a moment, we HEAR THE SOUND OF
      FOOTSTEPS ON CEMENT.</sd>

      INT. GARAGE -

      <sd>The lights come on. The car is a twisted wreck, smashed against the
      wall. Bond and Sidney are slumped forward, unconscious.

      Harmsway KNOCKS TWICE ON THE GARAGE DOOR, to demonstrate:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              No. I have a better idea. In fact,
                 Mr. Bond may have actually improved

                       (beat)
                 Bring them both to Hong Kong. And

      DISSOLVE TO:

      EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING -

      <sd>It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating
      restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an
      LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk;
      where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes
      and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256... While the
      captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones.

      At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the CAMERA FINDS:

      THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.

      Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to:

      THE SAME SCENE ON A 5" PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR -

      With one important difference: There's an HNN logo in lower corner.</sd>

                 As part of our continuing report on

                 Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant...</sp>

      NEW ANGLE (EXT. POWER PLANT, FRONT ENTRANCE, WATERSIDE) -

      <sd>Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a
      middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the
      "over the shoulder" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT.

      (There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a
      seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.)</sd>

                 Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this
                 plant from a terrorist attack?</sp>

      <sd>He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>CHIN</spk>
                 Totally secure. Without codes, you'd
                 need a missile to blast through the
                 front door; you normally can't even get
                 this close (to the plant) without a full
                 security clearance.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER</spk>
                 ...Could you say that a little closer
                 to the microphone?</sp>

      <sd>He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>CHIN</spk>
                 Of course. You'd need -</sp>

      <sd>Suddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And
      CHIN COLLAPSES. The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT: IT'S YUNG.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>
                       (to the guards)
                 Now!</sp>

      <sd>At once, the two cameramen turn: One AIMS his shoulder-mounted video
      camera at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; the other aims at the FRONT DOOR.

      BOOM! ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>
                 Let's go!</sp>

      <sd>As Yung and the cameramen rush forward -

      ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT -

      Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box
      of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Get the machine in the water!</sp>

      <sd>They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold.
      (This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top,
      and no flexible tubing attached.)</sd>

      INT. HALLWAY/RECEPTION - POWER PLANT -

      <sd>Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception/security area:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>POWER PLANT GUARD</spk>
                 What happened out there?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>
                 A generator blew. Nothing to worry about.

                 But I need one last shot of you. Why

                              <sp><spk>POWER PLANT GUARD</spk>
                 No problem.</sp>

      <sd>The guard stands, and smiles, posing for the video camera... And Yung
      pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>
                       (to the cameramen)
                 Up the stairs!</sp>

      <sd>They follow Yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control
      room. Meanwhile, back at the HNN boat:</sd>

      INT. CABIN - HNN BOAT

      <sd>Bond is at the porthole, wearing only shorts, trying to figure a way
      out. He hears the door click open, and -

      A Guard enters carrying a pile of Bond's clothing with his shoes on
      top. Stamper is behind him, holding a gun on Sidney.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              Put on your clothes.
                       (to the guard)
                 Cuff him.</sp>

      <sd>The guard cuffs Bond's hands (in the front,) and we cut back to:</sd>

      INT. POWER PLANT CONTROL ROOM -

      <sd>Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room: Lots of con-
      soles, with a window overlooking the REACTOR CORE, and its
      surrounding blue COOLING POOL.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>
                       (to the half-dozen engineers)
                 I'm sorry to interrupt again. But we
                 need one more picture for the story.</sp>

      <sd>The engineers ad-lib replies: "Sure." "Okay." Yung smiles:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>YUNG</spk> (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you line up against the
                 wall? Let's make it a group shot.</sp>

      <sd>The engineers line up against a wall. The cameramen take positions
      for a massacre. And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to:</sd>

      EXT. ENTRANCEWAY -

      <sd>Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Sleep well?</sp>

      <sd>Bond gives her a look.

      RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

      Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable
      version of the "worm" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>              The drill is in the water;
                 approaching the intake tunnel.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Excellent.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway looks up, hearing:</sd>

                 ...With a toxic core at its center.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at
      gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney...
                 You're just in time for a nuclear

      <sd>Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him -</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              You bastard -</sp>

      <sd>Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage.
      He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember

      UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL -

      <sd>The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the
      grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars.</sd>

      <sd>Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try

                          <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>              We're through the first gate.

                 calls for British government to resign.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway smiles at Bond:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow
                 never lies.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            What about the gold?</sp>

                          <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>              You must go. Now. Otherwise the
                 boat won't be out of range -</sp>

      <sd>Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Thirty seconds.
                       (then, to Bond)
                 That's the most brilliant part of the
                 plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy,
                 I'll let the new British government -
                 my British government - announce that
                 the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong
                 - where no one will be able to touch
                 it for a hundred years.
                       (beat)
                 And just by coincidence:</sp>

      <sd>He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              ...Gold mine opens in Vietnam.
                       (turns to Stamper)
                 Let's go. Put them in the airlock.</sp>

      <sd>Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            You'll never get away with it,
                 Harmsway. Too many people know.</sp>

      <sd>Bond tenses, ready to spring -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the
                 crazies - the conspiracy theorists?
                 The Oliver Stones of the world?
                       (pausing, then, with great scorn:)
                 I'll publish their books, I'll make
                 their movies, I'll put them on my TV
                 shows!
                       (beat)
                 They're my bellboys. They carry my
                 luggage.</sp>

      <sd>Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Now. Get them in the airlock.</sp>

      <sd>Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And
                 the handcuffs. They'll give it away.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              No. I want to stay with him.</sp>

      <sd>Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he
      realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could
      hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"...

      But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's
      running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (breaking the moment, cynically)
                 How sweet.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>                    (satto, to Bond)
                 My timing always was lousy.</sp>

                 I'd rather die alone.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs.
                 We'll drown her at sea.</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>                    (to Bond, sarcastically)
                 Enjoy the rest of your life.</sp>

      <sd>As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              I'll meet you on the boat, south of
                 Lantau Island.</sp>

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      <sd>The door closes. Bond looks out the small window at:

      HARMSWAY AND YUNG IN THE CONTROL ROOM -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>              Take the men. I can finish alone.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (to the technicians and cameramen)
                 You come with me -
                       (to the guard who handcuffed Bond)
                 You stay here.</sp>

      <sd>As they exit -</sd>

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      <sd>Bond has yanked his shoes off. He pulls out the PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVE
      SHOELACES and opens the SECRET COMPARTMENT IN HIS HEEL, revealing a
      DETONATOR, and EAR PLUGS.

      Moving quickly, Bond BITES OFF a 2-inch piece of shoelace, and wraps
      it around the chain-link connecting his handcuffs, while...</sd>

      INT. CONTROL ROOM -

      <sd>Yung sits down at the worm control and explains to the guard:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>              We'll cut through the last gate, then
                 set it on auto-pilot.</sp>

      <sd>He starts to maneuver the joystick, and -</sd>

      UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL -

      <sd>The worm turns a corner. We see -

      THE WORM'S POV - (INT. INTAKE TUNNEL MOVING) -

      100 feet ahead: An iron gate. Beyond it, the blue lights from the
      reactor cooling pool... And beyond that... THE REACTOR CORE, a
      shimmering silver target.

      Meanwhile, back outside, at -

      THE DOCK -

      Water sprays violently as the HNN boat thunders out of Aberdeen
      harbor with Harmsway at the helm. Junks and sampans are tossed in
      his wake, as</sd>

      INT. AIRLOCK -

      <sd>Bond finishes pressing the SHOELACES AROUND THE DOOR LOCK... Then
      TURNS UP HIS SHIRT COLLAR TO PULL OUT A WIRE that's been hidden
      inside.

      He connects it between the explosive on the handcuff chain and the
      detonator, then steals a glance out the window at:

      YUNG -

      still guiding the worm with the joy stick. His eyes are focused on:

      THE CONTROL PANEL (INCLUDING VIDEO SCREEN, SHOWING WORM'S POV) -

      Where Yung sees the gate looming ahead on the video screen. He
      presses a nearby button marked "START GRINDERS"... And the video
      goes black, replaced by the words "GRINDERS ENGAGED."

      UNDERWATER -(INTAKE TUNNEL) -

      The worm bares its lethal teeth; and revs up to speed. Meanwhile -

      BOND -

      Closes his eyes, presses the detonator, and -

      YUNG -

      HEARS a small BOOM from inside the airlock.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>YUNG</spk>                    (to the guard)
                 Check it out. Be careful.</sp>

      <sd>The guard picks up his machine pistol, starts to the door.</sd>

      INSIDE THE AIRLOCK -

      <sd>Bond (with his hands now free) is quickly rewiring the detonator to
      the plastique explosive around the door handle.

      YUNG MANEUVERS THE JOY-STICK, AS -

      UNDERWATER (INTAKE TUNNEL)

      The worm's teeth are beginning to cut into the steel bars.

      THE GUARD APPROACHES THE DOOR.

      BOND BRACES HIMSELF INSIDE THE AIRLOCK.

      THE GUARD PEERS INTO THE WINDOW -

      And suddenly... BOOM! The door blows open with a shattering blast!

      NEW ANGLE - THE CONTROL ROOM -

      The guard is blasted backward, dead. Bond rolls out, scrambling for
      the weapon. Yung slams his hand on a button marked "AUTO-PILOT." A
      caption appears on the video screen "TARGET LOCKED," and -

      As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of
      him. They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards
      the window overlooking the blue cooling pool.

      Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun. Yung takes a
      shortcut - leaping on, and then over the console, as -

      THE WORM (UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL) -

      Chews through the last of the iron bars, and glides through the hole
      toward THE SILVERY REACTOR CORE, 35 feet ahead.

      BOND AND YUNG -

      have squared off in a short, brutal MARTIAL ARTS battle.

      (The fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the
      reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them.)

      They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own,
      Yung is every bit his equal.

      Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick -

      But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing
      against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

      Meanwhile, all through this...

      THE WORM IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE CORE.

      RETURN ON BOND AND YUNG -

      As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher
      from the wall. He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2.

      In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond,
      headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND
      BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW.

      THE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop
      himself from falling backwards into the reactor room...

      Yung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -

      But at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's
      momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into -

      THE REACTOR ROOM.

      He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as -

      THE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE.

      SCREAMING, YUNG HITS THE WATER FEET FIRST, AND -

      UNDERWATER (REACTOR CORE) -

      THE WORM BURROWS IN ON HIM.

      RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -

      Bond races to hit the "EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN" button. He pulls
      a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an "EMERGENCY
      DECONTAMINATION" system, spraying the room with a mist of water.

      Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at:

      THE REACTOR POOL (BOND'S POV) -

      There's a cloud of RED in the middle of the blue water.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Bond goes to the dead guard. Gets the key, removes his handcuff
      bracelets, then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder, and exits.</sd>

      EXT. HELICOPTER - (EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR POWER PLANT) - DAY

      <sd>With the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond
      straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off.</sd>

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - (AERIAL - SOUTH CHINA SEA) - DAY

      <sd>The HNN boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin II. The gang from
      the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat.

      (Note: From the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now
      covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open,
      hanging from a steel boom.)

      THE DECK -

      Coming up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Any news?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>THE CAPTAIN</spk>
                 The call just went out on the Hong
                 Kong police radio: Fire at the power
                 plant.</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (ironically)
                 Alert the media!</sp>

      <sd>Stamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              What do you want me to do with her?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              - Can't we make a deal? I won't say

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (touching her cheek)
                 You're so cute, my dear.
                       (beat)
                 But I'm afraid not.
                       (to one of the cameramen)
                 Put her in the storage room.</sp>

      <sd>The cameraman takes her away. Harmsway turns to the captain:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk> (CONT'D)
                 We'll get rid of her when we're in
                 International waters.
                       (then)
                 Set sail, full speed, due south.
                 I'll be in my cabin. Let me know
                 when Mr. Yung arrives. We'll break
                 out the champagne.</sp>

      INT. LOWER PASSAGEWAY/STORAGE ROOM - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      <sd>Near the engine room (indicating we're near the bottom of the boat,)
      the cameraman opens a door to a small, cramped room with a bench, and
      SCUBA EQUIPMENT. He pushes Sidney inside.</sd>

                              <sp><spk>CAMERAMAN</spk>
                 Don't get any ideas.</sp>

      <sd>Then locks the door on her.</sd>

      EXT. BOND'S HNN HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY

      <sd>Several hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an
      island in the distance.</sd>

      INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING -

      <sd>Bond checks the compass, and adjusts his course. The COMPASS SWINGS
      DUE SOUTH.

      BOND'S POV -

      The helicopter clears the island: Bright blue sea ahead. Bond sees
      then passes over - the HNN boat, bobbing empty in the water...

      Then, further ahead, he spots the stern of Sea Dolphin II, shimmering
      in the instance.

      REAR DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      Looking north, off the back of the boat Stamper and a crewman see the
      helicopter - a tiny speck in the air.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              There it is.</sp>

      <sd>Stamper lifts a pair of BINOCULARS for confirmation.

      STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

      He sees two figures in the cockpit.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Stamper picks up his radio:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              It's him. They both made it.</sp>

      <sd>THE BRIDGE -

      The Captain replies:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>THE CAPTAIN</spk>
                 I'll tell Sir Elliot.</sp>

      <sd>HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      Harmsway is working at a computer. A chime sounds.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Yes?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>CAPTAIN'S VOICE</spk>
                 He's approaching from the north, sir.</sp>

                              <sp><spk>CREWMAN</spk>
                 Fantastic. Invite the crew on deck
                 to celebrate, and I'll be up in a few
                 minutes.</sp>

      INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY -

      <sd>Bond is about two miles out from the stern of the Sea Dolphin II.
      Maybe 500' in the air.

      Taking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the
      small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees. Ahead, he sees:

      BOND'S POV - DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -

      The crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the
      ship's railings.

      RETURN ON BOND -

      Ready for war. He pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward, and the
      Bell Jetranger goes into a screaming descent.

      THE DECK/HELICOPTER LANDING PAD

      Champagne bottles pop. Stamper is with a crewman, who looks up at
      the chopper, about 1000' off the stern:</sd>

                              <sp><spk>CREWMAN</spk>
                 He seems to be coming in awfully fast.</sp>

      <sd>Stamper picks up his binoculars.

      STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -

      He sees Bond.

      RETURN TO SCENE -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              Get the guns! It's not him! It's
                 Bond!!!</sp>

      <sd>He might have also added "It's too late," as -

      NEW ANGLE - REAR DECK OF THE BOAT/HELICOPTER -

      Bond SWOOPS IN LOW on the port side of the boat, FIRING HIS GUN from
      the pilot's window, and using the CHOPPER'S BLADES to threaten the
      men on deck.

      About half of them DIVE INTO THE WATER FOR SAFETY, only to be quickly
      left behind.

      Flying up the port side toward the front of the boat, Bond passes -</sd>

      INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      <sd>The windows rattle as Bond's chopper thunders by. Perplexed,
      Harmsway stands, opens the porthole curtains. He cranes his neck,
      but sees nothing. He presses an intercom button:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              What the hell is going on?</sp>

      INT. BRIDGE -

                              <sp><spk>THE CAPTAIN</spk>
                       (on a phone)
                 I don't know sir -</sp>

      <sd>The helicopter suddenly appears in front of him. Shooting from the
      pilot's window, Bond shatters the glass windows -

      And the Captain slumps forward on the wheel, spinning it as he slides
      to the deck.</sd>

      INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -

      <sd>The boat pitches wildly; Harmsway looses his balance, crashing into a
      wall.</sd>

      INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      <sd>Sidney is thrown from her bench, slamming against scuba tanks.</sd>

      EXT. MID-SHIP - DECK -

      <sd>Stamper bounces himself, handing out AUTOMATIC WEAPONS from an arms
      cache hidden inside a DINGHY.

      The two cameramen take their M-16's and rush forward, jumping up on
      some machinery to climb onto -

      THE ROOF OF THE BRIDGE -

      They rush forward, and assume positions shooting at Bond.

      ANGLE ON THE HELICOPTER -

      Taking hits. Bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for
      them.</sd>

      BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER) -

      <sd>The men turn, and start to run as the chopper chases them -

      CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER'S LANDING SKIDS -

      BOND HOOKS BOTH OF THEM WITH THE SKIDS, BY THE BACK OF THEIR UNTUCKED
      SHIRTS!!!!   The man are flailing like crazy as -

      BOND PULLS BACK ON THE CYCLIC PITCH LEVER -

      THE HELICOPTER REARS BACKWARDS, AND UP -

      And the men burst through their shirt buttons, FALLING, SHIRTLESS,
      into the sea.</sd>

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      <sd>Bond pushes the cyclic sideways to bank down, and in, on the boat.
      But he doesn't see -

      WIDE - (BOAT/HELICOPTER)

      A SMALL ROCKET STREAKING UPWARD from the boat. Stamper is holding a
      shoulder mounted launcher.

      THE HELICOPTER -

      BOOM! It hits the engine.</sd>

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      <sd>The gauges go crazy; the alarms go berserk. The entire cockpit is
      chattering as Bond struggles to remain in control.</sd>

      EXT. LADDER LEADING TO THE BRIDGE -

      <sd>HARMSWAY is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat
      continues to veer out of control. He pauses to look up at:</sd>

      THE HELICOPTER, GYRATING WILDLY -

      INT. HELICOPTER -

      <sd>Bond forces the cyclic forward. The helicopter pitches forward -

      BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER)

      He's heading straight for the hatch covering the gold hold. Whoever
      is left alive is diving off the ship to get out of the way.</sd>

      INT. BRIDGE -

      <sd>Struggling with the wheel, Harmsway picks up the radio:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              What the hell is going on?</sp>

                              <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk> (O. S. )
                 It's Bond!</sp>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Kill him! Finish it!</sp>

      <sd>ANGLE ON STAMPER (EXT. MID-SHIP) -

      With the worm dangling from a boom in the background, he watches:</sd>

      EXT. HELICOPTER/SHIP

      <sd>With the chopper about 15 feet above the gold hold - just barely
      under control - Bond opens the door.

      He leaps out onto the hatch, and rolls off, disappearing as -

      THE CHOPPER CRASHES onto the gold hold, in a GIANT BALL OF FLAME and
      twisted metal.</sd>

      INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT -

      <sd>Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion.</sd>

      INT. BRIDGE -

      <sd>Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead
      captain, and pushes the body out.</sd>

      EXT. PASSAGEWAY -

      <sd>With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily
      moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship.

      (Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any
      threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.)

      Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the
      passageway, then pokes his head inside -

      And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown
      against a railing.

      Bond looks up:

      STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his
      head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached
      to the boom by a thin metal cable.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              You're mine now.</sp>

      <sd>Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch.
      With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him
      against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.

      As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a
      wall, and THE WORM comes to life.

      Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.

      Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond
      against the wall with his free hand as he -

      MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.

      With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>STAMPER</spk>              I'm going to do this slowly -</sp>

      <sd>Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles
      sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm -

      But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is
      rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.

      Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews
      into the wall.

      Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same
      action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond.

      INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -

      With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in
      the cable, on the ground.

      RETURN TO SCENE -

      Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in
      the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -

      And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE
      SIDE OF THE SHIP.

      UNDERWATER -

      The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull.

      SIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) -

      Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall.</sd>

      HARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) -

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (barking into the radio)
                 Stamper! Report in!</sp>

      EXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY -

      <sd>As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick -</sd>

                              <sp><spk>HARMSWAY'S VOICE</spk>
                       (continuing, on Stamper's radio)
                 Report to the bridge!</sp>

      <sd>BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing
      taught as the worm wends its way underwater.

      Stamper rushes Bond -

      And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around
      Stamper's neck.

      Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and -

      STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as -</sd>

      INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      <sd>THE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in,
      pushing Sidney off to one side.

      WORM'S POV - INT. STORAGE CABIN -

      It's zooming at the door!</sd>

      INT. PASSAGEWAY -

      <sd>The door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway.</sd>

      INT. BRIDGE -

      <sd>The boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a
      wall, cutting his head.</sd>

      EXT. THE DECK -

      <sd>As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge,
      using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper:

      First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof.</sd>

      INT. STORAGE ROOM -

      <sd>Sidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the
      rising water and the ceiling.</sd>

      INT. PASSAGEWAY -

      <sd>3/4 filled with water. Rising fast.

      THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY)

      The worm is heading for a door. We see the door disintegrate in
      front of us, as the worm bursts into -

      THE ENGINE ROOM.

      With the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding
      inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked "FUEL."</sd>

      EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II -

      <sd>The boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when:
      THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE.</sd>

      INT. BRIDGE -

      <sd>Harmsway is thrown backwards. Gun in hand, he makes his way up the
      incline, to the port-side door.

      Just when he thinks he's made it -

      Bang. Bond appears in the doorway, having jumped down from the roof
      on the small exterior walkway. He's seething with rage.

      Harmsway looks up at him. Blinks in disbelief.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I never believe what I read in the
                 newspapers.</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway slowly brings up the gun.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              Pity you'll miss your obituary.</sp>

      <sd>Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt. Moves closer.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Where is she, Harmsway?</sp>

      <sd>BOOM! The fuel tanks explode in the distance. The bridge rocks
      violently; the room tilts to a greater angle.</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              You want to kill me, Bond? Go ahead.</sp>

      <sd>With both arms, Bond pushes Harmsway backwards, flinging him downward
      against the starboard wall. The water is rising on the bridge.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>                  (moving in on him)
                 Where is she Harmsway? -</sp>

      <sd>He grabs Harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front
      wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first.

      Harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges:</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>              What is it, Bond? You haven't the
                 guts?</sp>

      <sd>Boom! There's another explosion in the background! The front of the
      boat tilts upward! The water is rushing in!

      Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder -</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            You spineless paper tiger -</sp>

      <sd>And yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards
      against the rear wall of the bridge.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            Where is she, Harmsway?!? Or did you
                 kill her like Paris?</sp>

      <sd>Suddenly, THE BOAT GROANS. The BRIDGE RISES OUT OF THE WATER! AND
      BOND loses his balance, FALLING ONTO HARMSWAY -</sd>

                          <sp><spk>HARMSWAY</spk>                    (glaring, insanely:)
                 We all go down together!!!</sp>

      <sd>Harmsway lunges for Bond's throat -

      AND THE BRIDGE SLIPS UNDERWATER -

      Where Bond breaks Harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then
      punches him. Air bubbles break from Harmsway's mouth. He
      frantically tries to break free for the surface -

      But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on
      Harmsway's shoulders.

      Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at
      Bond in a haze of bubbles...

      Then falls still.

      With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up -

      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

      through the bridge windows, up to -

      THE SURFACE.

      He breaks through the water, gasping for air... And then, almost
      instantly, dives down again.

      UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -

      Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could
      just grab it, and stop it from sinking.

      He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away,
      just beyond his reach.

      And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his
      breath a second longer -

      A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM.

      Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She
      puts her regulator in Bond's mouth...

      And they share the air as they rise from the depths.

      THE SURFACE -

      They break through the water. Sidney yanks off her mask. Teases:</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              What do you mean, you'd rather die
                 alone?</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            I didn't say when I want to die -</sp>

      <sd>She splashes him. Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache'
      dinghy floating nearby.

      NEW ANGLE - THE DINGHY -

      Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in. They collapse in the
      bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale.

      After a beat, SIDNEY CLEARS HER THROAT. Bond is already amused:</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... Yes???</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Before we go any further here, Mr.
                 Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just
                 want to get two things straight.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            ... Yes?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              First, that boat is in international
                 waters. I'm claiming it for salvage.
                 One-third of that gold is mine.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            And number two?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              If you think we're going to have some
                 kind of 'life affirming' romance here
                 just because we cheated death, let me
                 be clear:
                       (pause)
                 We're going to have it where I want,
                 and when I want.</sp>

                           <sp><spk sex="M">BOND</spk>            And when might that be?</sp>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              Now.</sp>

      <sd>He laughs. She falls into his arms. They kiss, and we cut to:

      TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS -

      With the dinghy reflected in the glass. In unison, they are both
      lowered, revealing Q and Wade.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="M">Q</spk>              ... As usual, I see the situation is

                 Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the

      <sd>Q and Wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off:</sd>

      <sd>CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF HARMSWAY ON A VIDEO SCREEN -

      On the wall behind M's DESK. It's night. Moneypenny sits across
      from M, with a steno pad.</sd>

                           <sp><spk sex="F">M</spk>            Moneypenny, take the following release:
                       (beat)
                 The body of Sir Elliot Harmsway was
                 found floating in the South China Sea
                 this morning, at 08:00 hours local
                 Hong Kong time.
                       (pauses)
                 At present, local authorities believe
                 the media mogul committed suicide.</sp>

      <sd>RETURN ON THE DINGHY -

      Bond and Sidney break off a kiss. She lies nestled in his arms.</sd>

                          <sp><spk sex="F">SIDNEY</spk>              James... Is this really what a

      <sd>And with this, he reaches up over his head, and pulls a tarp over the
      two of them...

      And the camera pulls back, and up, rising into the air to reveal:

      The entire British Navy closing in on them from all points of the
      compass.</sd>

                            <sd>James Bond will return.</sd>
