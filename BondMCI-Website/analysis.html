        <h2>On the Songs</h2>
        <p>Our main focus on analyzing the songs focused on a few things. Firstly was each intro songs use of a keyword. We defined a keyword as the film's title or a variation on the title appearing in the lyrics, a thematic element of 007 appearing in the song's lyrics, or a unique word or reference in the song's lyrics. Secondly we looked at the song's use of perspective and when that switched between first, second, and third person point of view.</p>
        <h2>On the Scripts</h2>
        <p>Our focus in the scripts was to record how long speaking parts lasted for male characters vs female characters and tracking that over time.</p>
