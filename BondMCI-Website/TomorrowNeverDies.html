         EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN
         
         <i>Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN
            
            We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known
            World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.
            
            In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.
            
            Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
            over a cliff:
            
            AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.
            
            Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
            the ice. A human figure. This is:
            
            JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.
            
            Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
            an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
            backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
            JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -
            
            CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
            below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
            looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:</i>
         
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b>            There has to be an easier way to earn
            a living.</p>
         
         <i>Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -
            
            ANOTHER ANGLE -
            
            He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a
            toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -
            
            THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -
            
            BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -
            
            And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of
            water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached
            to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.
            
            Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and
            forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.
            
            At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other
            pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:
            
            THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
            
            Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.
            
            RETURN ON BOND -
            
            Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on
            the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.
            
            ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
            
            Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally
            frayed through.
            
            RETURN ON BOND -
            
            One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
            himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
            ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,
            he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick <i>barely
               holding in the ice,</i> jabs it in, and continues upward.</i>
         
         EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -
         
         <i>Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -
            through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.
            
            As he pulls himself up, <i>his full weight on the first ice-pick,</i> he
            smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -
            
            THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -
            
            Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.
            
            IN THE WATERBED -
            
            A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,
            he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.
            
            NEW ANGLE - <i>TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND</i>
            
            Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:
            
            BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -
            
            On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled
            down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
            In other words: This was the only way in.
            
            RETURN ON BOND -
            
            007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
            CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the
            side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.
            
            He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
            slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.</i>
         EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -
         EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -
         
         <i>Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
            amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.</i>EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -
         
         <i>Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the
            bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:
            
            A ROCK OUTCROPPING.
            
            Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He
            unpacks <i>and unfolds</i> a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a
            HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:
            
            A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP <i>BOND'S POV</i>
            
            50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen
            MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the
            ground <i>one partially obscured by a truck,</i> plus FLATBEDS carrying
            HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.
            
            Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with
            INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.
            
            BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
            
            Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.
            
            THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -
            
            He sees a closer <i>but still wide</i> telescopic view of men bargaining
            over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

            Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway

            of Aberdeen? That his Scottish
            ancestors practically invented Hong
            Kong - and out of sheer gratitude,
            Queen Victoria herself named the port
            "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?</p>

            supposedly started his own negotiations

            Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats,

            their chins. They look like messengers of death.

            The leader is STAMPER; the others are locals, THUG #1, #2, #3. <i>THUG

         <i>Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of
            the bridge. At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -
            
            THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.
            
            BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing
            up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -
            completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.
            
            BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,
            dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.
            
            STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -
            
            And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES
            PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper and Co.</i>

         <i>Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.
            
            Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but
            Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.
            
            RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND <i>DOWN</i> STAIRCASE - NIGHT
            
            As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:
            
            THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing
            carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -
            
            But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes
            right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,
            pulling the men down, after him.
            
            BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
            
            Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:
            
            A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -
            
            and just beyond this -
            
            A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.
            
            BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the
            picture for him.</i>

         <i>Bond takes the camera. The tourists pose. And with perfect timing,

            The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart
            stops on top of him, pinning him down.
            
            BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.
            
            Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS
            in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed
            off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -
            
            007 disappears down the sidestreet.
            
            Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO
            MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of
            the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT
            INTO THE CANAL.
            
            RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -
            
            Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug
            #1 disappear onto the side Street.
            
            Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course
            along the canals toward -
            
            THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT
            
            Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close
            to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.
            
            ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -
            
            Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.
            
            BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA
            
            Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and
            start looking for him.
            
            RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -
            
            Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:
            
            THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast
            move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing
            it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from
            under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.
            <i>He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.</i>
            
            NEW ANGLE -
            
            Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the
            courtyard of Il Bovolo.
            
            RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -
            
            Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he
            pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the
            cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -
            
            The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,
            hurling him against the opposite wall.
            
            With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.</i>

         <i>They charge off.
            
            IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT
            
            Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No
            way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH
            FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.
            
            THE SPIRAL STAIRS -
            
            Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.
            
            RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -
            
            The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR
            BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.
            
            THE BALCONY -
            
            Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the
            building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the
            courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.
            
            Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.
            
            Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the
            GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and
            disappears from sight...
            
            Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.
            
            FIRST ROOFTOP -
            
            Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are
            SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop
            to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.
            
            SECOND <i>LOWER</i> ROOFTOP -
            
            007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold
            on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:
            The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.
            
            As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -
            
            RETURN ON THE BALCONY -
            
            Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy
            to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.
            
            FIRST ROOFTOP -
            
            Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the
            next building. He makes a running leap.
            
            SECOND <i>LOWER</i> ROOFTOP -
            
            Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They
            grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the
            roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.
            
            AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the
            skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.
            
            007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1
            tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO
            BOND'S LEGS.
            
            They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the
            two of them fall -
            
            CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -
            
            VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.
            
            They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the
            Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the
            collar, hauling him up on his feet.
            
            Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up
            on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:</i>
         
         
         <p><b>THUG #1:</b>
            I owe you some pain.</p>
         
         <i>With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his
            gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just
            clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.
            
            The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,
            and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.
            
            As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally
            <i>yet effortlessly</i> SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.
            
            With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.
            He's having fun.
            
            AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -
            
            THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.
            
            BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR <i>on wheels</i> at Thug #1 - who bats it out
            of the way, like a gnat.
            
            Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from
            the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.
            
            Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,
            and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword.
            
            With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.
            The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:
            
            A DISPLAY WALL -
            
            filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.
            <i>Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.</i> Thug #1 stops in his tracks.
            Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.
            
            THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug
            #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.
            
            NEW ANGLE -
            
            Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond
            backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.
            <i>Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.</i>
            
            Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the
            last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from
            killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.
            
            As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. <i>A
               studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club</i>
            
            Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN
            TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.
            
            Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the
            wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM
            THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  -

                  THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER.
                  
                  One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a
                  CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007.

                  STUFFS THE SACK INTO HIS BAGGY SWIM TRUNKS.
                  
                  Bond rockets up, SLAMMING INTO DIVER #1. A confusion of bubbles.
                  
                  And just as Bond overcomes the man - spinning him around, holding the

                  DIVER #2 SHOOTS the HARPOON-TYPE GUN, and A DOLPHIN NET explodes out,

                  each other against the side of the press...
                  
                  Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and
                  pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,
                  Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -
                  
                  And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops
                  him on the head with the crowbar.
                  
                  Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -
                  
                  But one of the Guards <i>from the crashing roll of newsprint</i> darts out
                  from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.
                  
                  Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard
                  as he comes to finish Bond off.
                  
                  The Guard stumbles backward -
                  
                  Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. <i>A large machine that
                     wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.</i>
                  
                  Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the
                  BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that
                  as Bond turns -
                  
                  The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.
                  Seemingly at once, <i>1</i> Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, <i>2</i> Bond
                  ducks, <i>3</i> the Guard shoots wildly, <i>4</i> the gun drops, and <i>5</i> -
                  
                  Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,
                  pulling Sidney away at the last moment.
                  
                  The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...

                  Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the
                  passageway, then pokes his head inside -
                  
                  And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown
                  against a railing.
                  
                  Bond looks up:
                  
                  STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his
                  head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached
                  to the boom by a thin metal cable.</i>
               
               
               <p><b>STAMPER:</b>              You're mine now.</p>
               
               <i>Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch.
                  With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him
                  against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.
                  
                  As Bond recovers, Stamper <i>still smiling</i> presses a RED BUTTON on a
                  wall, and THE WORM comes to life.
                  
                  Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.
                  
                  Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond
                  against the wall with his free hand as he -
                  
                  MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.
                  
                  With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose -</i>
               
               
               <p><b>STAMPER:</b>              I'm going to do this slowly -</p>
               
               <i>Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles
                  sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm -
                  
                  But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is
                  rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.
                  
                  Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews
                  into the wall.
                  
                  Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - <i>same
                     action,</i> then a third <i>same action</i> - still missing Bond.
                  
                  INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -
                  
                  With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in
                  the cable, on the ground.
                  
                  RETURN TO SCENE -
                  
                  Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in
                  the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -
                  
                  And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE
                  SIDE OF THE SHIP.
                  
                  UNDERWATER -
                  
                  The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull.

            handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.
            
            UNDERWATER BOTTOM -
            
            Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.
            Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.
            
            EXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER -
            
            Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand.
            
            Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color.
            From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being
            lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge.

            BACK TO SCENE -
            
            Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to
            study the damage. Then enters.
            
            INT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER -

            The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the
            busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made
            by the worm. He drops into the hold.
            
            INT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER -
            
            The gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty
            space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another.
            
            As he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch.
            He moves toward it.
            
            NEW ANGLE - CLOSER -
            
            A half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead.
            Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold.
            
            Just as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the
            brace, baring its teeth.
            
            Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into:</i>
         
         <i>PASSAGE WAY - INT. INDOMITABLE - UNDER WATER -
            
            where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling.
            Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see:</i>
         
         <i>THE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR.
            </i>
         <i>BACK TO SCENE -
            
            Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll-
            ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD
            BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare.
            
            CLOSE ON HATCH/DECK -
            
            Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover.
            He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs
            it into his sack, and swims off.</i>
         
         <i>CUT TO:</i>
         
         <i>UNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR -</i>
         
         <i>Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the

            HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007.
            
            BOND -
            
            kicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks
            by. He looks up again:
            
            THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER.
            
            One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a
            CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007.
            
            BOND -
            
            Realizes his best chance is to take one of the men hostage.
            
            Flashing his KNIFE, Bond cuts the cord to his gold/uranium sack,
            STUFFS THE SACK INTO HIS BAGGY SWIM TRUNKS.
            
            Bond rockets up, SLAMMING INTO DIVER #1. A confusion of bubbles.
            
            And just as Bond overcomes the man - spinning him around, holding the
            knife to the diver's throat -
            
            DIVER #2 SHOOTS the HARPOON-TYPE GUN, and A DOLPHIN NET explodes out,

         INT. PRESS ROOM -
         
         <i>Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came down
            earlier to meet Harmsway.
            
            The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening.
            
            At the "start" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond
            sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE, about to be loaded.
            
            Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where
            Bond and Harmsway exited earlier. -
            
            Coming out of that DOOR, Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway Blazers
            carrying guns.
            
            BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL.
            
            It CRASHES TO THE GROUND, rolling backwards on the guards. As they
            start scrambling around it -
            
            Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc-
            tion <i>toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...</i>
            
            They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN, with an oversized crowbar.
            
            Bond and the Pressman square off. Bond tries to get around him. The
            man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it. Bond tries to block the
            descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.
            
            Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing
            each other against the side of the press...
            
            Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and
            pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,
            Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -
            
            And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops
            him on the head with the crowbar.
            
            Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -
            
            But one of the Guards <i>from the crashing roll of newsprint</i> darts out
            from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.
            
            Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard
            as he comes to finish Bond off.
            
            The Guard stumbles backward -
            
            Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. <i>A large machine that
               wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.</i>
            
            Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the
            BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that
            as Bond turns -
            
            The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.
            Seemingly at once, <i>1</i> Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, <i>2</i> Bond
            ducks, <i>3</i> the Guard shoots wildly, <i>4</i> the gun drops, and <i>5</i> -
            
            Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,
            pulling Sidney away at the last moment.
            
            The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...
            
            The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED.</i>
         
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b>            He was bad news.</p>
         
         <i>Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney
            and the gun, and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE.</i>

            The guard is blasted backward, dead. Bond rolls out, scrambling for

            caption appears on the video screen "TARGET LOCKED," and -
            
            As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of
            him. They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards
            the window overlooking the blue cooling pool.
            
            Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun. Yung takes a

               reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them.</i>
            
            They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own,
            Yung is every bit his equal.
            
            Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick -
            
            But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing
            against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
            
            Meanwhile, all through this...

            As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher
            from the wall. He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2.
            
            In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond,
            headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND
            BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW.
            
            THE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop
            himself from falling backwards into the reactor room...
            
            Yung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -
            
            But at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's
            momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into -
            
            THE REACTOR ROOM.
            
            He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as -
            
            THE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE.

            Bond races to hit the "EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN" button. He pulls
            a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an "EMERGENCY
            DECONTAMINATION" system, spraying the room with a mist of water.
            
            Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at:

         <i>With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily
            moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship.
            
            <i>Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any
               threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.</i>

            Bond looks up:
            
            STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his
            head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached
            to the boom by a thin metal cable.</i>
         
         
         <p><b>STAMPER:</b>              You're mine now.</p>

            With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him
            against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.
            
            As Bond recovers, Stamper <i>still smiling</i> presses a RED BUTTON on a
            wall, and THE WORM comes to life.
            
            Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.
            
            Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond
            against the wall with his free hand as he -
            
            MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.

            But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is
            rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.
            
            Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews
            into the wall.
            
            Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - <i>same
               action,</i> then a third <i>same action</i> - still missing Bond.
            
            INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -
            
            With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in
            the cable, on the ground.
            
            RETURN TO SCENE -
            
            Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in
            the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -
            
            And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE
            SIDE OF THE SHIP.
            
            UNDERWATER -
