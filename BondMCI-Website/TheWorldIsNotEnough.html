         <i>GUN BARREL LOGO OPENS ON GENEVA SWITZERLAND, an unnaturally clean city that melds
            old
            Europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source. INT. HALLWAY OFFICE
            BUILDING - DAY An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the "private banking
            institute" within. INT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY JAMES BOND, dressed
            impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by three THUGS in Armani suits. They remove A
            GUN
            from inside his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them on the desk
            that separates Bond and... LACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind
            him,
            three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden.</i>
         
         <p>
            <b>LACHAISE:</b> Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man
            in my position..</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Which is neutral, no doubt</p>. <i>Lachaise takes the joke a little
            tight-lipped. Gestures for Bond to sit.</i>
         <i>A GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped suit. She pushes a cart.
            On
            it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and
            Bond.</i>
         
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the money. No doubt Sir Robert will
            be pleased to see it again.</p>
         <i>The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond, setting it in his lap and opening
            it up...inside is a good deal of CASH in pound sterling.</i>
         
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> In the current exchange rate, minus the fees, of course, and certain
            unforeseeable expenses. Here is the receipt...</p>
         <i>The CIGAR GIRL offers Bond a RECEIPT</i>... 
         <p><b>CIGAR GIRL:</b> Would you like to
            check my figures?</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Perhaps later.</p>
         <i>She steps back. Bond reaches for the metal case on the desk...the THUGS TENSE...</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> My glasses.</p>
         <i>Lachaise nods. Bond can have his glasses. He puts them on, gives a cursory look at
            the
            receipt...an odd number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny:
            3,030,303.03.</i>
         
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> It's all there.</p>
         <i>Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he removes the glasses, slowly,
            deliberately, eyeing Lachaise.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> I didn't come for the money. The report you sold him was stolen from an
            MI-6 agent, who was killed for it</p>. <i>He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it
            on the desk</i>. 
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> I did not get the report from an MI-6
            agent</p>. 
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Who did you get it from?</p>
         
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and
            returning the money to its rightful owner...</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.</p>
         
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> (controlled fury) Your last chance. Take the money.</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Your last chance. Give me the name.</p>
         
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?</p>
         <i>He nods. An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun...</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Perhaps you failed to take into account my...hidden assets.</p>
         <i>Bond's mouth edges into a smile. A flicker of doubt on Lachaise's face -- as Bond's
            finger finds a protrusion on the tiny arm of his glasses and... KABOOM! The pistol
            on
            the table FLASHES...blinding those around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it
            is a
            brief effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his opening... He
            KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun. Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face
            and
            throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW just as they're getting their bearings. Now he nestles the
            barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's cheek.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> The name?</p>
         
         <p><b>LACHAISE:</b> I can't tell you... (Bond cocks the gun) Alright, alright! But you
            must protect me!</p>
         <i>And he freezes. The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking out of his neck. Bond looks
            up, catches sight of the CIGAR GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE
            ROOF. Bond rushes to the window... EXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY She swings
            on a
            WIRE across to another roof, quickly disappearing into shadows. Bond can hear sirens
            approaching. He returns to... THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the
            door, casually slipping that cigar into his pocket... Except Henchman #1 has recovered,
            blocks his way, gun in hand. He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT appears
            on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet zings through and pierces the
            henchman in the heart. Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out.
            INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building,
            by the
            elevator. Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the stairs. Hears the elevator cage
            start from below. Thinking fast, he wrenches open the steel gate, leans into the lift
            shaft, watches the elevator COUNTERWEIGHT as it comes down. Almost nonchalant, he
            steps
            out... INT. STAIRWELL/ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY As the cageful of police rises, Bond is
            now
            standing on the counterweight, DESCENDING. EXT. STREET - GENEVA Lunchtime. Faceless
            business crowds heading for their brief moment of freedom, among them we spot BOND...one
            of them, with a briefcase and a suit and tie...HOLD on his face, troubled. INT. HOTEL
            -
            GENEVA - DAY The Cigar Girl enters a huge, high-ceilinged room. Edgy, she approaches
            a
            BIG MAN standing on a balcony overlooking the city. Propped against the doorframe,
            an
            assassin's RIFLE with LASER-SIGHT attached. BINOCULARS are on a tripod, trained on
            the
            rooftop below where we can see cops examining the shattered office windows. The man
            turns. Powerful, deadly, with a military haircut. There is a raised, red scar of an
            ENTRY WOUND at his temple. It throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression,
            like an insect living just beneath his skin. One EYE seems slightly drooping, deadened.
            The other eye is sharp and black as anthracite. It is a frightening face. This is
            RENARD.</i>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> What's his name? Our friend from MI-6?</p>
         
         <p><b>CIGAR GIRL:</b> James Bond.</p>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> One of M's more accomplished tin soldiers.</p>
         
         <p><b>CIGAR GIRL:</b> He could identify me.</p>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> If it concerns you...kill him.</p>
         <i>He touches her cheek and moves into the room, pouring two glasses of wine.</i>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> Let's toast this James Bond. We're in his hands now...</p><i>EXT. RIVER THAMES - LONDON - DAY A SEAPLANE swoops over the Millennium Dome,
            banks along the snaking river. EXT. MI-6 - LONDON - DAY Tate Gallery in background,
            the
            seaplane moors beneath the vast stepped cake that is MI-6. Bond exits with the suitcase.
            INT. SECURITY, MI-6 - DAY CAMERA MOVES with Bond as he enters this secret, hi-tech
            world. He passes through countless security procedures, watched by an attentive staff.
            Bond scoops the money out of the suitcase. Three million sterling in tightly bundled
            hundreds makes quite a sight. He flicks his finger through the last wad, tosses it
            down
            wistfully. A blue light scans it on three axis. The money is bundled into a clear
            plastic bag, put on a tray and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into
            the
            SECURE ROOM. Bond hands the suitcase to a STAFF MEMBER.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Have this checked, see what you can get off it.</p>
         <i>INT. MONEYPENNY'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY Bond appears, hiding something behind his back.
            Moneypenny brightens.</i>
         
         <p><b>MONEYPENNY:</b> James. Brought me a souvenir from Geneva?</p>
         <i>He produces the cigar, now in a large phallic TUBE. Stands it end up on the desk.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Thought you might want one of these. </p>
         
         <p><b>MONEYPENNY:</b> (beat, deadpan) I gave up a long time ago. (nods to M's door)
            She's in with Sir Robert.</p>
         <i>INT. M'S OFFICE, MI-6 - DAY Bond enters. SIR ROBERT KING is perched on the edge of
            M's
            desk. Two glasses, a bottle of scotch open.</i>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> Sir Robert King, James Bond.</p>
         <i>King moves toward Bond with an easy, patrician smile. Bond notes a TINY BADGE in his
            lapel -- like the glass eye of a stuffed snake.</i>
         
         <p><b>SIR ROBERT:</b> Thanks for getting my money back --never expected to see it again.
            You're the kind of man I could use. Though I won't offend certain parties by asking
            you
            to join King Industries.</p>
         <i>King looks to M, smiling.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Construction's not exactly my line.</p>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>
         <i>She couldn't resist. King smiles at Bond. As he goes, he gives M a respectful kiss
            on
            the cheek. The door closes. M turns.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Old friend?</p>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and
            enough guts to conquer the world. He's a man of great integrity.</p>

            FIGURE
            finishes placing a blue PLUTONIUM CORE into a box. As Bond and the Colonel walks toward
            the bubble, the FIGURE steps out, still enveloped in the white protective suit. Moving
            fast, off comes the helmet to reveal a BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN GIRL. CHRISTMAS JONES is
            mid-twenties, shortish hair, hot right now. In one movement she unzips and steps out
            of
            the suit, revealing a khaki sports bra, cut-off shorts, heavy duty boots. A
            nasty-looking hunting knife strapped around her hips. She has a deep tan and an
            incredible figure. She grabs a bottle of water, guzzles. Bond tosses an arched brow
            to
            Akakievich, who nods bitterly, also unable to take his eyes off her. He spits on the
            floor and speaks in ENGLISH, so Christmas can hear.</i>
         
         <p><b>COLONEL AKAKIEVICH:</b> Not interested in men. Take my word for it.</p>
         <i>Akakievich isn't exactly what you'd call a looker. Bond offers a disappointed tut

            silence in the shadows. Bond's in his element, that alert glint in his eye as he takes
            in his surroundings. HIS P.O.V. A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more open
            circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming there. Bond starts down the

            the
            centre of a web, a NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit. Blast openings range around
            to
            channel its fury to measuring equipment. Bond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment.
            Then, he comes to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the opposite
            side
            of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in Russian Army fatigues.</i>

         <p><b>MAN:</b> You can't kill me. I'm already dead.</p>
         <i>He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a ROBOT DEVICE beginning to
            lower it into the pit.</i>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> Go ahead. Shoot. My men will still steal the bomb, and the shot will
            bring them directly to you.</p>
         <i>Renard gestures into the pit. BOND'S P.O.V. TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware
            of
            what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One of them is using a
            manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner. Bond aims
            his gun at Renard's head.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?</p>
         <i>Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the pit, toward Bond, slowly,

         <p><b>RENARD:</b> To die by a man who can't even grasp what he's caught up in...</p>
         <i>Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove a SMALL DEVICE from inside
            the bomb. It is the size and shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors
            on
            it...the man slips it into his pocket.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's clever is getting someone else
            to pay for it.</p>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.</p>

         <p><b>RENARD:</b> You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for

            not such a whore in bed...</p>
         <i>Bond's eyes flare in fury. He shoves Renard into the wall and presses the gun to his

         <p><b>RENARD:</b> You even brought the plane for us. We really couldn't have done it
            without you.</p>
         <i>Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol. Renard drops to his knees. He
            touches his temple, looks at the blood curiously, feeling no pain.</i>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> A man tires of being executed.</p>

            and two armed soldiers. We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway
            and
            see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard -- classic execution
            stance:</i>
         
         <p><b>COLONEL AKAKIEVICH:</b> (to Bond) Drop your gun.</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Keep away, Colonel.</p>
         <i>The soldiers' guns are trained on Bond.</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> He is an impostor. (clutching a printout) There's no Davidov at
            Miratom.</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Here's your imposter. He's paid off the men on the plane outside.
            They're not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they're flying it wherever he
            tells
            them.</p>
         <i>Christmas is listening, but Akakievich cocks his rifle.</i>
         
         <p><b>COLONEL AKAKIEVICH:</b> (to Bond) I said drop it.</p>
         <i>And he means business. Bond delays ... but has no choice. He pulls the clip from his

         <p><b>RENARD:</b> (to Christmas) Well done -- he would have killed us all. I suppose you
            (to Akakievich) were you the one who allowed him down?</p>
         <i>Colonel Akakievich looks suitably stung. But Renard is looking past him now, as with
            a

            move.</i>

         <i>And Renard jams his hand onto Bond's shoulder, squeezing his collar-bone hard... Pain
            jolts through Bond, he drops to his knees in agony. He shoves Bond down. Bond's hand
            goes to his shoulder, his mind now racing -- how did he know to hurt him there? Renard's
            men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving passageway. It's all too much for
            Colonel Akakievich:</i>
         
         <p><b>COLONEL AKAKIEVICH:</b> No -- the bomb does not go anywhere until I am satisfied.

         <i>Renard stops and turns. Bond sees him nod to two of his men: one quietly slopes off
            down

         <p><b>RENARD:</b> (urgent now) Very well, Colonel. We will all go up.</p>
         <i>One of Colonel Akakievich's men gestures with his gun that Bond should get up. Knowing
            it's now or never, Bond PUSHES him away, yanks a PISTOL from his holster, GRABS
            Christmas, LEAPS down into the bomb PIT just as RENARD'S MEN open fire... Akakievich
            dies straight away. So do two of his men. The gunfire RICOCHETS around the chamber
            and
            ceases. Renard hangs back. His radio crackles a message:</i>
         
         <p><b>RENARD:</b> (nods, into radio) Shut them.</p>
         <i>THE GUY ON THE OTHER END OF THE RADIO Right next to the ELEVATOR. He turns a switch

            bullets. Watches uneasily as Bond takes out light after light. A funnel of darkness
            coming to swallow him -- concealing Bond's approach. Nervous, he fires, muzzle flash

            much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to the top deck of the steamer, Bond
            hitches a ride on a cargo net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom. EXT.

            by the side of the deck house. The Boa goes sprawling. As Bond comes for him he
            scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and swings at Bond. But Bond is
            ready for him. He wards off the blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.

            Elektra moves to her gun. Just then, Gabor crashes through a stained glass window,
            neck
            broken. TWO ELEKTRA HENCHMEN appear from below stairs as the doors burst open. Zukovsky
            stands there. A bloody giant. They open up with machine guns, but two shots from
            Zukovsky take them out, though he takes one in the shoulder. Right now, he's
            unstoppable. A shocked silence after the shooting. He eyes Bond in the chair. To the
            room:</i>
         
         <p><b>ZUKOVSKY:</b> I'm looking for a submarine. It's big and black, and the driver is a
            friend of mine.</p>

            it
            means.</i>
         
         <p><b>ZUKOVSKY:</b> Bring it to me.</p>
         <i>She picks it up, walks to him (surreptitiously sliding a gun beneath it). She proffers

         <i>BLAM BLAM BLAM -- she fires through the hat. He staggers back. Stares. Slumps down.
            Lowers his head to the ground. She walks over, puts her heel on his gun arm, presses
            down, smiling a half-psychotic smile. The gun is pinned. Zukovsky is dying. But he
            dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun a millimetre off the ground,
            his
            outstretched arm already pointing at Bond. Elektra looks surprised, then amused as
            Zukovsky's finger begins to squeeze the trigger: he's going to shoot Bond! Bond stares
            back. Zukovsky's eye narrows -- trying for extreme accuracy... BLAM! The SHOT hits
            the
            binding at Bond's wrist. Splinters the wood there. ELEKTRA stares at Zukovsky. She
            didn't see where the bullet went, just that it missed Bond. She watches his head slump
            further, staring at Bond... A look passes between the two men. Comrades in arms. The
            merest of smiles. Then the light fades from his eyes. Dead. ELEKTRA turns back to
            Bond.
            Smiles.</i>
         
         <p><b>ELEKTRA:</b> Excuse me.</p>

         <i>And she kisses him -- reaches behind to deliver the killer twist... One super-fast
            movement: Bond's hand breaks free, grabs her throat, tight. He holds her, their faces
            close together, disdain in his eyes -- hurls her backwards, her hand scratching at
            his
            face. Ripping the collar from his neck, he gets to his feet. Moves to Zukovsky, checks
            his pulse, takes the bloody gun from his fingers. Turns back, to see Elektra
            disappearing upstairs. A moment's dilemma: should he race below to the sub -- or up
            to
            Elektra? He takes off after Elektra, grabs the radio handset.</i><i>EXT. SUBMARINE - SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - DAY The submarine's engines

            Christmas.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Re-breathers.</p>
         <i>She opens the box to find the RE-BREATHERS are ripped to shreds. No-one was ever meant
            to get off the sub. She shows Bond.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Never liked those things anyway.</p>
         <i>He climbs into the escape chamber.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Count to twenty. When you get to twenty open the hatch. It can only be
            opened for a few seconds or we'll sink.</p>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> But what if...</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Count to twenty. I'll be there.</p>
         <i>She moves over and seals the door, wrenches a lever which immediately floods the chamber
            with water. INT. ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS Inside the chamber, Bond holds his breath
            as
            water seeps in. The most claustrophobic thing you've ever seen. INT. SUBMARINE -
            CONTINUOUS A green light comes on and Christmas punches a button... EXT. SUBMARINE,
            ESCAPE HATCH - CONTINUOUS The OUTER DOOR opens... Bond burst out and starts the long
            swim up the OUTSIDE OF THE SUBMARINE... INT. SUBMARINE - SAME Christmas is
            counting.</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> One, one thousand, two, one thousand...</p>
         <i>EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER It's dark out here. It would be very easy for Bond to
            get
            disoriented. He peers around, trying to get his bearings against the vast vertical
            whale
            he's swimming up. Passes the conning tower. INT. SUBMARINE</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> Fourteen, one thousand, fifteen, one thousand...</p>
         <i>EXT. SUBMARINE - UNDERWATER Bond is running out of air... And then he sees it -- the
            open hatch of the rear escape door. He gets inside, yanks it closed... INT. SUBMARINE
            -
            CONTINUOUS Christmas, shivering in the rising water.</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> Twenty.</p>
         <i>She presses a button... INT. CHAMBER BEYOND (NOW ABOVE) REACTOR - CONTINUOUS The hatch
            opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water. The hatch closes. The whole world
            is at
            a crazy angle here. Bond looks down at the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses.
            INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS Bathed in the horrible light of the over-heating
            reactor, Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of the door...
            KER-BLAM! A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. The door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond.
            Bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard, now a crumpled heap in
            the
            corner. Bond moves down to the next door, opens it:</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Christmas!</p>
         <i>And there she is, struggling, the water level way below still rising... He lowers
            an
            arm, pulls her up. They clamber up to the reactor: INT. REACTOR CHAMBER BOND'S POV:
            in
            the intense glow inside -- the overheating rod, protruding slightly.</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> We have to get the rod out of the reactor!</p>
         <i>INT. REACTOR CHAMBER Bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick GLASS SHIELD.
            Christmas comes up level with him:</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> Melting down. 4000 degrees, the Zirconium casings on the rods
            crack. 5000, the plutonium melts. In ten minutes, a hydrogen explosion.</p>
         <i>THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READS 4500 AND RISING... He starts toward the reactor when
            suddenly RENARD IS BEHIND BOND, THROTTLING HIM. CHRISTMAS grabs at him, is flung back,
            nearly falls through the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life.
            THE
            GAUGE HITS 4700 BOND AND RENARD struggle... Both slamming into switches and
            buttons.</i><i>OMITTED 314-316 INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS THE GAUGE IS PASSING 4900,
            EDGING TOWARDS THE NO-WAY-BACK 5000 MARK. Meltdown imminent... He looks down the sub
            --
            more water racing upward... Back to the pile. Scans the scene, searching for an idea.
            Sees a HOSE, compressed air escaping from a fissure. Thinks fast. Grabs the hose,
            snaps
            it free... RENARD is recovering, has found a FLARE GUN near him. Raises it to Bond...
            BOND'S POV in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from 5000), we see
            Renard approaching from behind us... BOND jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down
            --
            as the air blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past -- impales Renard
            in the heart, just before he could shoot. Renard stares at Bond in horror. Bond calmly
            takes the flare gun off him.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> She's waiting for you.</p>
         <i>And he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open hatches of the sub,
            crashing into the rising water. Christmas looks down at the floating corpse. Bond
            watches the gauge -- as it edges DOWN from 5000. The nuclear disaster looks like it's
            averted. But suddenly water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's
            shell;
            it's going to sink.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> We're sinking.</p>
         <i>But she won't come. As water courses over them:</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> Help me. We have to seal it.</p>
         <i>She moves to the reactor, closing the cover. Bond uses his strength to push the heavy
            locking mechanism into place. Bond climbs upwards, dragging Christmas with him.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> We've got to get out.</p>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> We can't.</p>
         <i>INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR - CONTINUOUS They clamber into the next chamber up...
            EXT.
            SUBMARINE, BOSPHORUS - CONTINUOUS The submarine is slowly sinking, nose down. Air
            is
            escaping from the many seams that are creeping apart. We can hear the metallic GROANS
            through the water. INT. TORPEDO ROOM Bond and Christmas crawl into TORPEDO CHAMBERS...
            Bond reaches out, setting a timer to FIRE... The clock ticks down... EXT. SUBMARINE
            -
            UNDERWATER BOSPHORUS - DAY The Torpedo doors open and Bond and Christmas are SHOT
            OUT
            INTO THE WATER, streaking through, as behind them... THE SUBMARINE EXPLODES in
            spectacular fashion. EXT. SURFACE, BOSPHORUS - DAY Bond and Christmas reach the
            surface... Look around them. No boats coming to the rescue. They wave to a tourist
            boat
            passing. The boat heads over to pick them up...</i><i>OMIT 324 EST. SHOT - MI-6 - NIGHT The damaged wing is being repaired. INT.
            BRIEFING ROOM - SAME Tanner overseeing things, and then... M walks in. Efficient and
            steely as ever. All eyes turn to her. She looks at everyone...makes the briefest of
            nods. That is all the sentiment allowed as business resumes. She scans the
            machines:</i>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> Any word from him?</p>
         
         <p><b>TANNER:</b> Still no contact yet.</p>
         <i>EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - NIGHT A magnificent rooftop garden looking out over Istanbul.
            Christmas and Bond alone with some Bollinger. FIREWORKS explode above. They clink
            glasses. He looks out at the cityscape.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> I love Christmas in Turkey.</p>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> So isn't it time you unwrapped your present?</p>
         <i>INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT Tanner and Q look at a SATELLITE THERMAL IMAGE OF
            ISTANBUL.</i>
         
         <p><b>TANNER:</b> That's strange.</p>
         <i>The satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a side street. We can just
            make out Bond's ASTON MARTIN.</i>
         
         <p><b>TANNER:</b> He must be nearby.</p>
         <i>M comes over. The image moves from the car, closes on the garden rooftop. The thermal
            image is multi-coloured, difficult to decipher.</i>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> Where?</p>
         
         <p><b>Q:</b> This picks up body heat. Humans should be orange. (searching) There.</p>
         <i>And he points to ONE orange figure lying on the rooftop.</i>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> (to Tanner) I thought you said he was with Doctor Jones?</p>
         <i>They all look back to the image. The figure is turning RED, almost glowing.</i>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> It's getting redder.</p>
         <i>Tanner, Q and M realize as one that this is an image of two people, one atop the other.
            And getting hotter.</i>
         
         <p><b>M:</b> Bond.</p>
         <i>Q switches the screen off, clears his throat.</i>
         
         <p><b>Q:</b> Could be a premature form of the Millennium Bug.</p>
         <i>EXT. ROOF, ISTANBUL - CONTINUOUS It's dark, we can't really see them.</i>
         
         <p><b>CHRISTMAS:</b> You know James... I think Christmas is coming early this
            year.</p>
