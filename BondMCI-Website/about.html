        <h1>About the project</h1>
        <!-- Format:  Black Ops Doc. .-. links with XML-Intro-Song markup, and XML-Screenplay markup -->
        <p>The intro songs went very smoothly during our markup process. The lyrics and song notes were found on Genius which made finding all the songs an easy process. We determined a logical way to mark up the songs and built a schema. Some of the pieces of the songs that we wanted to explore were how often the filmâ€™s title appears in the song, what point of view the songs reference, and the general structure of the songs themselves.
        </p>
           <p> A lot of the problems that we ran into were related to the screenplays. The way that a screenplay is formatted is very particular and the notation has slowly changed throughout the years. This gave us some problems with finding consistent ways to mark them up. Irregular spacing and formatting was the biggest factor in slowly down our progress. The screenplays ended up being mostly done by hand or some very tedious regEx.
