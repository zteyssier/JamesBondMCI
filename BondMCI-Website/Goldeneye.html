            runs
            across the top of the tall dam. He clips a rope to his ankle and the railing...and
            jumps off the
            side. As he sails down, he pulls out a gun-type thing and shoots it. A wire follows
            attaching in

            Hanging
            upside down from a vent. He flashes a grin.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Beg your pardon, forgot to knock.</p>
         <i>007 punches out the Soviet and slips down.</i>
         
         Int. Hallway - Same time
         <i>Bond slips un-noticed through dim halls, wielding his Walther PPK with a silencer
            on it. He
            spots a butcher loading meat onto a cart, and he walks up to an opening where he sees
            soldiers
            eating. As he turns away...another dark shadow points a gun at him...and says something.</i>
         
         <p><b>SHADOW:</b> (Russian) Where have you been? Where are your companions?</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> I'm alone.</p>

         <p><b>ALEC:</b> Aren't we all? You're late 007.</p>

         Int. Hall - Day
         <i>Bond's blue eyes spot someone in the hall. Waiting 'til the coast is clear, he jumps
            out of
            the vent in the floor while Alec climbs out. Both men walk down the hall. Alec enters
            a
            laboratory with a plate-glass window and shoots the guy inside. Meanwhile, Bond has
            a device
            plugged into and ID card slot with a number pad under it. He waits for a click,</i>
         <i>and the door unlocks. Both men walk inside....</i>
         Int. Gas room - Day
         <i>...A room filled with nerve gas tanks.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> It's too easy.</p>
         
         <p><b>ALEC:</b> Half of everything is luck, James.</p>
         <i>Alec turns and plugs the device into the same panel, jamming the door.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> And the other half?</p>
         
         <p><b>ALEC:</b> Fate!</p>
         <i>A red light sounds, signaling the alarm of the plant. The men run down the stairs.</i>
         
         <p><b>ALEC:</b> Set timers to six minutes!</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Six minutes, check.</p>
         <i>A few Soviets burst through a door, 006 shoots them. Bond starts to arm a little explosive
            timer. A digital clock pops up...6.00. James and Alec scurry around behind the gas
            tanks planting
            the timers. An ugly-looking Soviet commander, Ourumov, stands behind a plexi-glass
            window.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> FIRE!</p>
         <i>Soldiers fire their guns, breaking the window. 006 and 007 are still planting the
            timers.</i>
         
         <p><b>ALEC:</b> Closing time, James! Last call!</p>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Buy me a pint!</p>
         <i>The Soviets pour through the opening. Trevelyan fires at them.</i>
         <b>OURUMOV :</b> I am Colonel Ourumov. Come out with your hands above your heads!
         <i>While planting a timer...</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> How original.</p>
         <i>More Soviets pour through a door.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Shut the door, Alec! There's a draft!</p>
         <i>No answer.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Alec?!</p>
         <i>He looks for 006. Alec in kneeling under the gun of Ourumov. Thirty soldiers all have
            their
            guns pointed at Bond.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> Move out! Throw down your weapon and walk towards me. Slowly.</p>
         
         <p><b>ALEC:</b> Finish the job, James! Blow them all to hell!</p>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> You have 10 seconds. 10...9...8...</p>
         <i>Bond goes back to the detonator he just planted and sets it for 3.00.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> ....7...6..5...4..</p>
         <i>Bond throws his weapon on the floor, puts his hands behind his head and approaches
            Ourumov.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> ...3......2....</p>
         
         <p><b>ALEC:</b> For England, James!!</p>
         <i>BOOM. Alec is silenced. He flops over. The Soviet soldiers fire their automatic rifles.</i>
         <i>Bond retreats behind the tanks again.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> Hold your fire! You'll blow the gas tanks!</p>
         <i>They do. Bond recovers his gun.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> This is your last chance! Come out with your hands above your head....</p>
         <i>Ourumov's P.O.V. - a dark shadow moves behind a cart with tanks piled on it. The soldiers
            raise their guns...</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> WAIT!</p>
         <i>Bond moves slowly with the cart acting as a shield. Ourumov seems amused....one soldier
            thinks
            he can get a shot off...and fires. Bond retreats farther behind the cart. Ourumov
            turns and
            shoots the guy in the face...he warned him.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> You can't win.</p>
         <i>Yeah, sure. Bond quickly hits the on button to a conveyer belt leading outside. He
            jumps on
            and fires the assault rifle. The Soviets fire back, but Bond hits the grate to a storage
            area
            above their heads. More gas tanks pour out on the Soviets. And Bond tumbles down the
            conveyer
            belt onto...</i>
         
         Ext. Runway - Day
         <i>Bond sees a small plane....his ticket outta here. More soldiers burst through a hangar
            door
            and what's behind door number 2...even more pour out onto the runway. Bond crouches
            behind some
            piping and fires, hitting a few. The gun runs out and he dashes through the snow toward
            the
            plane. We hear Ourumov's shouting in the backround.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> Hold your fire!</p>
         <i>Cut to 1000 yards out: the facility is on a mountain-top. Cliffs, very high up. Back
            to the
            action...Bond runs down the plane and drags himself inside, fights with the pilot.
            Now there's
            soldiers chasing Bond on motorcycles. Both 007 and the pilot tumble out of the plane.
            A
            motorcycle runs over the pilot, causing the bike to throw its rider. Bond</i>
         <i>jumps on the bike and chases the runaway plane.</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> WAIT!!</p>
         <i>The plane sails off the cliff, and so does the motorcycle with 007 still on it. He
            flies off
            the bike and sails to the dive-bombing plane. He grabs the open door and pulls himself
            inside and
            into the pilot's seat. Uh-oh! The stick's not working, not responding! Oh crap!</i>
         <i>We see Bond's blue eyes start to panic...then just in time the plane soars upward
            as the
            chemical weapons facility explodes.</i>

         <p><b>MISHKIN:</b> Please, deliver your report.</p>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> As this council is aware, 72 hours ago, a secret weapons program codename
            GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya. As head of Space Division, I personally undertook
            the
            investigation. I have concluded this crime was committed by Siberian separatists,
            seeking to
            create political unrest. Incredibly the peaceful work and much needed hard currency
            earnings of
            Severnaya have been set back by several years. Therefore, I tender my resignation.</p>
         <i>The council makes some noise, shaking their heads "Niet" "No".</i>
         
         <p><b>MISHKIN:</b> It seems the council does not want your head, Akadi Gregorovich, merely
            your loyal assurance that there are no other GoldenEye satellites.</p>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> I can't give you that assurance, Defense Minister.</p>
         
         <p><b>MISHKIN:</b> And what of the two missing Severnaya technicians?</p>
         <i>Ourumov freezes. Two?! Where did two come from?!</i>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> I was aware only of the one. Boris Grishenko.</p>
         <i>Mishkin glances at a paper...</i>
         
         <p><b>MISHKIN:</b> There was a girl, also, whose body was not among the dead. Natalya Fivoriva
            Simonova, a level-two programmer.</p>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> I will investigate immediately, Defense Minister.</p>
         
         <p><b>MISHKIN:</b> It would seem presumptuous, General, to blame this incident on Siberian
            separatists before the whereabouts of your own people are determined.</p>
         <i>The Council looks like a bunch of statues.</i>
         
         <p><b>MISHKIN:</b> Do you agree?</p>
         
         <p><b>OURUMOV:</b> YES, Defense Minister. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.</p>

            wage war
            against the Communists. But the British betrayed them. Sent them back to Stalin who
            promptly had

         <i>A shadow moving through the pool water. James surfaces right in front of the camera,
            then
            pushes off the side of the cement pool floating on his back. Nice pool, circular,
            with huge
            pillars surrounding it...we see a door open and someone walks in, circling the pool.
            James is
            still floating peacefully when he notices someone's watching him. Wait! Isn't that...?!
            He climbs
            out of the pool. He grabs a towel and dabs his face. Then he grabs his Walther. James
            pulls the
            person by the arm, pulling them into a steam room. He aims the gun at...Xenia. Wearing
            only a
            loosefitting robe. James is a little interested. His chiseled body is still soaked,
            hair slicked
            back...looking sexy...</i>
         
         <p><b>XENIA:</b> You don't need the gun, Commander.</p>

         <i>They kiss. James tosses the gun on a massage table. She pulls away, with his lower
            lip
            clenched in her teeth. Bond flinches and pushes her to the wall. He touches his lip,
            a little
            blood, but enough to get him pissed off. He goes for the gun...Xenia kicks him to
            the ground
            before he can get it. She jumps on top of him, he rolls on top of her...</i>
         
         <p><b>XENIA:</b> You think you can hurt me?</p>
         <i>James gets off of her, and goes for the gun again. Xenia pushes him onto the massage
            table,
            and jumps on him. Normally, Bond would love this - but she's crushing his rib cage.
            He gasps, and
            tries to pry her legs off his torso. He gets up, with Xenia still hanging on with
            her legs, and
            slams her against the wall.</i>
         
         <p><b>XENIA:</b> You think you can break me?</p>
         <i>They kiss again wildly...She squeezes harder, Bond's eyes pop open and he runs slamming
            Xenia
            into another wall. Now she's screaming...he sits her on the steam grate. Another guy
            has heard
            the screaming and Bond swiftly knocks him out. He flips Xenia over his shoulder, finally
            off of
            him. Now he gets the gun and aims it at her.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> No, no, no. No more foreplay.</p>
         <i>He cocks the gun.</i>

            While your parents had the luxury of dying in a climbing accident, mine survived the

            betrayal and Stalin's execution squads. But my father couldn't let himself or my mother
            live with
            the shame of it. MI6 figured I was too young to remember. And one of life's little

            never to

            up with

            their path:
            traffic. Bond crashes through a truck with boxes of Perrier on it, and then a statue
            of a man

            abruptly
            halts the tank and the cars collide with the backside of the tank. Bond looks back
            at the damage,

            top of screaming Alec.</i>
         
         Int. Control deck - Day
         <i>Boris pokes his head out of the rubble. In pieces, but he's still alive. He jumps
            up
            triumphantly.</i>
         
         <p><b>BORIS:</b> I am invincible!!!</p>
         <i>Spoke too soon, pal. Just as he says that the liquid nitrogen tanks explode, freezing
            him
            into place.</i>
         Ext. Field - Day
         <i>The chopper lets Bond fall to the ground in a clearing. Natalya jumps out, and it
            flies away.
            She drops on top of him. He flinches in pain. She's worried, and stokes his black
            hair from his
            forehead.</i>
         
         <p><b>NATALYA:</b> James! James! Are you all right?!</p>
         <i>Bond recovers. Flashes a grin. Likes the position she put him in...</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.</p>
         <i>They kiss, happy to be alive. They roll over so Bond's on top. Natalya grins.</i>
         
         <p><b>NATALYA:</b> Suppose someone is watching....</p>
         <i>He continues to kiss her. They're in the middle of nowhere, for god's sake.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> There's no one in twenty-five miles, believe me.</p>
         <i>They kiss again. We hear a familiar voice...</i>
         <b>WADE :</b> Yo! Jimbo!! <i>There he goes with the 'Jimbo' again...James is
            really startled, he flips suddenly to his knees as soon as he hears that Southern
            accent. God,
            it's Wade. In camo.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Is this supposed to be your idea of...um...coming through in a clinch?!</p>
         
         <p><b>WADE:</b> It's the back-up plan. Hey, I'd said I'd be here, huh? Yo! Marines!</p>
         <i>Wade gives the USMC sign to reveal your position. About thirty-five Marines appear
            from
            nowhere, rising from the grass. Helicopters land around. What's that...Bond's blushing
            a
            little!</i>
         
         <p><b>WADE:</b> Maybe you two would like to finish de-briefing each other at Guantanamo?</p>
         <i>Bond looks at Natalya.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> You ready?</p>
         
         <p><b>NATALYA:</b> I'm not going on that helicopter with you...</p>
         <i>Bond flashes her a quizzical look.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Hmmm?</p>
         
         <p><b>NATALYA:</b> No plane! No train! Nothing that moves!</p>
         <i>He picks her up. She's still giggling. He gives us that grin again.</i>
         
         <p><b>BOND:</b> Darling, what could possibly go wrong, eh?</p>
         <i>The helicopters load up and fly out. Fade up on the credits, complete with JAMES BOND
            WILL
            RETURN.</i>
