        <p>Ever since Dr. No hit cinemas in 1962, The 007 films have been a large part of our global pop culture. Today, they are some of the highest grossing films of all time. What is it about these movies based on the iconic character created by Ian Flemming that makes us adore them. Our mission is to analyze the song and scripts of every Bond film ever made and determine what about them has changed over the course of over 50 years. </p>
