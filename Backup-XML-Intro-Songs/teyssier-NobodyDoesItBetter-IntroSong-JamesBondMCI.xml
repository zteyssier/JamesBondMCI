<Verse type="1">Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>
Baby, <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>’re the best</Verse>


<Chorus type="1"><FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> wasn’t looking
But somehow you found me
<FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> tried to hide from your <KeyWord>love</KeyWord> light
But like heaven above me
<FilmTitle>The spy who loved me</FilmTitle>
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
</Chorus>


<Verse tpye="2">And nobody does it better
Though sometimes <FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why d’you have to be so good?
</Verse>

<Chorus type="2">The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There’s some kind of magic inside <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>
That keeps me from running
But just keep it comin’
How’d <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV> learn to do the things <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV> do?
</Chorus>

<Verse type="1">Oh, and nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>
Baby, baby, darlin’ <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>’re the best
</Verse>

<Verse type="1">Baby <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>'re the best
<Unique>Darlin'</Unique>, <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>'re the best
Baby <SecondPersonPOV>you</SecondPersonPOV>'re the best</Verse>
