<lb/>by the merciless eyes Ive deceived?</Verse>

<Verse cat="Verse" type="2"><lb/>I've seen <KeyWord>angels</KeyWord> fall from blinding heights,
<lb/>but <POV V="2">you</POV> yourself are nothing so <KeyWord>divine</KeyWord>,
<lb/>just next in line.</Verse>

<Verse cat="Chorus" type="1"><lb/>Arm yourself because no one else here will save you,
<lb/>the odds will betray you and <POV V="1">I</POV> will replace <POV V="2">you</POV>,
<lb/>you can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you,
<lb/>It longs to kill you, are you willing to die?
<lb/>the coldest blood runs through <POV V="1">my</POV> veins,
<lb/>you know my name.</Verse>

<Verse cat="Verse" type="3"><lb/>If <POV V="2">you</POV> come inside things will not be the same,

<lb/>the game that we have been playing.</Verse>

<Verse cat="Bridge" type="5"><lb/>Try to hide your hand, forget how to feel,
