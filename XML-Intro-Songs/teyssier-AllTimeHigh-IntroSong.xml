<IntroSong>[Verse 1]
<Verse type = "1">All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two
Had no intention to do the things we've done
Funny how it always goes with <KeyWord>love</KeyWord>
When you don't look, you find
But then we're two of a kind, we move as one</Verse>


<Chorus type = "1">We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in <KeyWord>love</KeyWord>
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and wait
So hold on tight, let the flight begin</Chorus>

[Verse 2]
<Verse type = "2">I don't want to waste a waking moment
I don't want to sleep
I'm in so strong and so deep, and so are you
In my time
I've said these words before
But now I realise
My heart was telling me lies
For you they're true</Verse>


<Chorus>We're an all time high
We'll change all that's gone before
Doing so much more than falling in <KeyWord>love</KeyWord>
On an all time high
We'll take on the world and wait
So hold on tight
Let the flight begin</Chorus>


<Outro>So hold on tight
Let the flight begin
We're an all time high</Outro>
