<IntroSong>
<Verse type = "1">See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface in every shadow
On the wind I feel his breath
<FilmTitle>Golden eye</FilmTitle> I found his weakness
<FilmTitle>Golden eye</FilmTitle> he'll do what I please
<FilmTitle>Golden eye</FilmTitle> no time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees
</Verse>

<Chorus type = "1">You'll never know how I watched you
From the shadows as a child
You'll never know how it feels to be the one
Who's left behind
You'll never know the days, the nights
The tears, the tears I've cried
But now my time has come
And time, time is not on your side</Chorus>


<Verse type = "2">See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls they gather around him
If I had him I wouldn't let him out
<FilmTitle>Golden eye</FilmTitle> not lace or leather
<KeyWord>Golden</KeyWord> chains take him to the spot
<FilmTitle>Golden eye</FilmTitle> I'll show him forever
It'll take forever to see
What I've got</Verse>


<Chorus type = "2">You'll never know how I watched you
From the shadows as a child
You'll never know how it feels to get so close
And be denied
It's a <KeyWord>gold</KeyWord> and honey trap
I've got for you tonight
Revenge it's a kiss, this time I won't miss
Now I've got you in my sight
With a <KeyWord>Golden eye</KeyWord></Chorus>


<Outro type = "1"><KeyWord>Golden</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>golden eye</FilmTitle>
With a <FilmTitle>golden eye</FilmTitle>
<FilmTitle>Golden eye</FilmTitle></Outro>
