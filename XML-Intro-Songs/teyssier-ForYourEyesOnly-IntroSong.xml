<SongTitle>For Your Eyes Only</SongTitle>   
<Verse type = "1" cat = "Verse"><FilmTitle>For your eyes only</FilmTitle>, can see me through the night
<FilmTitle>For your eyes only</FilmTitle>, I never need to hide</Verse>

<Verse type = "1" cat = "PreChorus">You can see so much in me
So much in me that's new
I never felt, until I looked at you</Verse>

<Verse type = "1" cat = "Chorus"><FilmTitle>For your eyes only</FilmTitle>, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
<FilmTitle>For your eyes only</FilmTitle>, only for you
The love I know you need in me
The fantasy you freed in me
Only for you, only for you</Verse>

<Verse type = "1" cat = "Verse"><FilmTitle>For your eyes only</FilmTitle>, the nights are never cold
You really know me, that's all I need to know</Verse>
    
<Verse type = "2" cat = "PreChorus">Maybe I'm an open book
Because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines</Verse>

<Verse cat = "Chorus" type = "1"><FilmTitle>For your eyes only</FilmTitle>, <KeyWord group = "FilmTitle">only</KeyWord> for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
<FilmTitle>For your eyes only</FilmTitle>, only for you
The passions that collide in me
The wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, <FilmTitle>for your eyes only</FilmTitle></Verse></IntroSong>
