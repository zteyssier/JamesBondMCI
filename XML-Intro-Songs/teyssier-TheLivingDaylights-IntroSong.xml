<IntroSong>
<Verse type = "1">Hey driver, where we going?
I swear my nerves are showing
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die</Verse>

<PreChorus type = "1">Comes the morning and the headlights fade away
Hundred thousand people, I'm the one they frame
I've been waiting long for one of us to say
"Save the darkness, let it never fade away"</PreChorus>


<Chorus type = "1">Oh, the living daylights
Oh, the living daylights</Chorus>


<Verse type = "1">All right, hold on tight now
It's down, down to the wire
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die</Verse>


<PreChorus type = "1">Comes the morning and the headlights fade away
Hundred thousand changes, everything's the same
I've been waiting long for one of us to say
"Save the darkness, let it never fade away"</PreChorus>


<Chorus type = "2">Oh, the living daylights
Oh, the living daylights
Oh, the living daylights</Chorus>

<Interlude/>


<PreChorus type = "1">Comes the morning and the headlights fade away
Hundred thousand people, I'm the one they frame</PreChorus>


<Chorus type = "2">Oh, the living daylights
Oh, the living daylights
Oh, the living daylights</Chorus>


<Outro type = "1">Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die
Set your hopes up way too high
The living's in the way we die</Outro></IntroSong>
