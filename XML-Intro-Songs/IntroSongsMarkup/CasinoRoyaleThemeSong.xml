<IntroSong><Verse type="Intro" num="1">If you take a life do you know what you'll give?
odds are you won't like what it is,
when the storm arrives would you be seen with me,
by the merciless eyes Ive deceived?</Verse>

<Verse num="2">I've seen angels fall from blinding heights,
but you yourself are nothing so divine,
just next in line.</Verse>

<Chorus num="1">Arm yourself because no one else here will save you,
the odds will betray you and I will replace you,
you can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you,
It longs to kill you, are you willing to die?
the coldest blood runs through my veins,
you know my name.</Chorus>

<Verse num="3">If you come inside things will not be the same,
when you return to the night,
and if you think you've won you never saw me change,
the game that we have been playing.</Verse>

<Verse num="4">I've seen diamonds cut through harder men,
than you yourself but if you must pretend,
you may meet your end.</Verse>

<Chorus num="2">Arm yourself because no one else here will save you,
the odds will betray you and I will replace you,
you can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you,
It longs to kill you, are you willing to die?
the coldest blood runs through my veins.</Chorus>

<Verse type="bridge" num="5">Try to hide your hand, forget how to feel,
life is gone with just a spin of the wheel.</Verse>

<Chorus num="3">Arm yourself because no one else here will save you,
the odds will betray you and I will replace you,
you can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you,
It longs to kill you, are you willin' to die?
the coldest blood runs through my veins,</Chorus>
you know my name.

<Verse type="Outro" num="6">You know my name,
you know my name,
you know my name,
you know my name.</Verse></IntroSong>
