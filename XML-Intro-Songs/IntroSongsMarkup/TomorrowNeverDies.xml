<IntroSong><Verse type="1">Darlin' I'm killed,
I'm in puddle on the floor,
waiting for you,
to return.</Verse>

<Verse type="2">Oh, what a thrill,
vacillations good Lord,
how you tease me,
how you leave me to burn.</Verse>

<PreChorus type="1">It's so deadly my dear,
the power of loving you near.</PreChorus>

<Chorus type="1">Until the day,
until the world falls away,
until you say, there will no more goodbyes,
I see it in your eyes,
<FilmTitle>tomorrow never dies</FilmTitle>.</Chorus>

<Verse type="3">Darling you won,
it's no fun,
martinis, girls and guns,
It's murder on our love affair.</Verse>

<Verse type="4">'Cause you bet your life,
every night,
while you chase every morning die,
you're not the only spy out there.</Verse>

<PreChorus type="2">It's so deadly my dear,
the power of wanting you near.</PreChorus>

<Chorus type="2">Until the day,
until the world falls away,
until you say, there will no more goodbyes,
I see it in your eyes,
<FilmTitle>tomorrow never dies</FilmTitle>.</Chorus>

<Chorus type="3">Until the day,
until the world falls away,
until you say, there will no more goodbyes,
I see it in your eyes.
</Chorus>
    
<Outro>Until the day,
until the day,
until the day.</Outro></IntroSong>
