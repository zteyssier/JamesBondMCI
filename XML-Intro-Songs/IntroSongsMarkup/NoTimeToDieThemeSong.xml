<IntroSong><Verse num="1"><FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was <FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?</Verse>

<Chorus num="1">That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die</Chorus>

<Verse num="2"><FirstPersonPOV>I</FirstPersonPOV> let it burn
You're no longer my concern, <Interjection>mmm</Interjection>
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn</Verse>

<Chorus num="2">That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die</Chorus>

<Verse num="3">No time to die, <Interjection>mmm</Interjection>
No time to die, ooh</Verse>

<Verse num="4" type="Outro">Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die</Verse></IntroSong>
