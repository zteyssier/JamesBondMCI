<IntroSong>
<SongTitle>Never Say Never Again</SongTitle>
<Verse cat = "Verse" type = "1"><POV V ="2">You</POV> walk in a room
A woman can feel the heat
One look is a guarantee
Nights could be long and sweet
The message is clear
Like nothing <POV V = "1">I</POV>'ve ever known</Verse>

<Verse cat = "PreChorus" type = "1">But the more that <POV V = "1">I</POV> hear
Forget about long-range plans
'Cause this man's got his own</Verse>
    
<Verse cat = "Chorus" type = "1">To get mixed up with a man who says <KeyWord group = "FilmTitle">never</KeyWord>
May be big trouble, but then
<POV V = "1">I</POV> just could be the woman to take <POV V = "2">you</POV>
And make <POV V = "2">you</POV> <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle></Verse>

<Verse cat = "Interlude" type = "1"><KeyWord group = "FilmTitle">Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle>
<KeyWord group = "FilmTitle">Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle>
<KeyWord group = "FilmTitle">Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle>
<KeyWord group = "FilmTitle">Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle></Verse>

<Verse cat = "Verse" type = "2"><POV V = "2">You</POV>'ve got all the moves
Ah, but baby <POV V = "1">I</POV>'ve got them too
No matter <POV V = "2">your</POV> attitude or <POV V = "2">your</POV> mood
<POV V = "1">I</POV>'ll come through
The touch of <POV V = "2">your</POV> voice
The feel of <POV V = "2">your</POV> eyes on <POV V = "1">me</POV></Verse>

<Verse cat = "PreChorus" type = "2">You leave <POV V = "1">me</POV> no choice
Though <POV V = "1">I</POV> know there's danger there
<POV V = "1">I</POV> don't care, let <POV V = "3">it</POV> be</Verse>

<Verse cat = "Chorus" type = "1">To get <POV V = "3">it</POV> bad with a man who says <KeyWord group = "FilmTitle">never</KeyWord>
May have no future, but then
<POV V = "1">I</POV> just could be the woman to reach <POV V = "2">you</POV>
And teach <POV V = "2">you</POV> to <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle></Verse>

<Verse cat = "Bridge" type = "1"><POV V = "1">I</POV>'ll beg <POV V = "2">you</POV>
<POV V= "1">I</POV>'ll get <POV V = "2">you</POV>
<POV V = "1">I</POV>'ll reach <POV V = "2">you</POV>
<POV V = "1">I</POV>'ll teach <POV V = "2">you</POV>
<POV V = "1">I</POV>'ll take <POV V = "2">you</POV>
<POV V = "1">I</POV>'ll make <POV V = "2">you</POV></Verse>
