<IntroSong>
<Verse>You walk in a room
A woman can feel the heat
One look is a guarantee
Nights could be long and sweet
The message is clear
Like nothing I've ever known</Verse>

<PreChorus>But the more that I hear
Forget about long-range plans
'Cause this man's got his own</PreChorus>
    
<Chorus>To get mixed up with a man who says <KeyWord>never</KeyWord>
May be big trouble, but then
I just could be the woman to take you
And make you <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle></Chorus>
<Interlude><KeyWord>Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle>
<KeyWord>Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle>
<KeyWord>Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle>
<KeyWord>Never</KeyWord>, <FilmTitle>never say never again</FilmTitle></Interlude>
<Verse>You've got all the moves
Ah, but baby I've got them too
No matter your attitude or your mood
I'll come through
The touch of your voice
The feel of your eyes on me</Verse>
<PreChorus>You leave me no choice
Though I know there's danger there
I don't care, let it be</PreChorus>
<Chorus>To get it bad with a man who says never
May have no future, but then
I just could be the woman to reach you
And teach you to never say never again</Chorus>
<Bridge>I'll beg you
I'll get you
I'll reach you
I'll teach you
I'll take you
I'll make you</Bridge>
