<Verse1>Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you’re the best</Verse1>


<Chorus>I wasn’t looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
</Chorus>


<Verse2>And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why d’you have to be so good?
</Verse2>

<Chorus>The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There’s some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it comin’
How’d you learn to do the things you do?
</Chorus>

<Verse3>Oh, and nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, darlin’ you’re the best
</Verse3>

<Verse1>Baby you're the best
Darlin', you're the best
Baby you're the best</Verse1>
